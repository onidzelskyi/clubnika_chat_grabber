I prefer not to believe that. I prefer instead to help those who may not =
have knowledge of little things like that acquire the knowledge. =
Personal computers and the Internet can be very daunting to anyone =
unfamiliar with it. What may seem obvious to you and me may not be so =
obvious to others, nor might the failing of such a thing to occur the =
designers of these features be obvious to them. None of that equates to =
stupidity.

Have you shared your belief with the members of your user group? Have =
you shared it with anyone at Apple who might be able to explore your =
concerns about that search box?
