It comes down to options.  There are none.  Gnash is not a viable 
option.  If it were, I would use it.

Oh, if you give me a plugin, as Flash is, then I can use anything I 
please.

True.  And even Javascript itself is subject to proprietary whims. 
After all, it depends on browser support.  If a particular browser 
becomes dominant for a while, it could dictate (for a while) it own 
implementation be the "standard", as Microsoft managed to do with IE6.

What I meant was, it's pushed code.  But it's any code the site owner 
desires, as long as the browser can interpret it.

Amazon, for example, depends heavily on Javascript, as does, of course 
Google.  They, *do* desire a fixed standard, because they can run on 
anything then, from a PC to a Blackberry, as long as it has a browser 
that supports Javascript.  Why use Flash when every browser already has 
what we need?  And with HTML5, the limitations are reduced, and I'm not 
just talking about the video tag.


MAA
