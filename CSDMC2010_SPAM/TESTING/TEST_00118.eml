Nope.  There are a few ways to deal with this; Joe mentioned a common
one, which is to have your password stored in a file that's outside of
your website directory.

Bear in mind, many, many people and businesses have successfully built
websites using both their own servers and host providers.  So for
almost any "wait, that can't be right, because it causes this
problem!" situation - there's almost certainly a readily available
solution.

Given that this is a Debian list, I should mention that Pair runs
FreeBSD systems, not Linux.

In my experience paying for web hosting - you do get what you pay for.
Pair is not the cheapest host in the business, but they have
had phenomenal uptimes, excellent support, and provide reasonable
access to the system.  I've been burned by cheap web hosts before -
including a company that cancelled a friend's account because he'd
typed "ls /etc" and they found it in his bash history file.  Wow.  I'm
not saying that you can't find a good host cheaper than Pair - for me
personally, Pair is cheap enough and good enough that I haven't looked
further since I started using them.  I should also note that I'm only
running a personal vanity site, not a business or service.  And if
you're not based in the US, I don't know how much sense it makes to
work with a US host provider.

I've never installed mysqladmin, so I can't speak to that.  I've
always just used command line tools for mySQL.

Anyway, I don't mean to sound like an advertisement for one particular
company.  I'm sure there are many reputable, reliable hosting
companies out there.  It does sound like you need a fair amount of
information to do this for the first time, so you might want to choose
a host provider that explicitly includes support as part of the deal.
