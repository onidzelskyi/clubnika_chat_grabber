So what? People moved on. You can do the same if current situation does not=
=20
suite you OR you can actually do something real to improve situation. Ranti=
ng=20
isn't among that "something".

Seriously, attacks on personal preferences is the best you can do? To be=20
honest, it's none of your business what everybody else is using and why.=20
Personal preferences are highly subjective and they say really nothing abou=
t=20
quality of other similar software in the market. By your logic, you should =
be=20
using Windows because apparently it is the best OS in the world due to=20
enormous PC market penetration (over 90%).

I tried to find a logic in this reasoning but utterly failed. If you are go=
ing=20
to respect Ana's work less just because she is using mutt, I believe we hav=
e=20
nothing to talk about.

Maybe. Yet what did you do to improve the situation? And maybe it was not j=
ust=20
KDE SC 4 fault, was it?
