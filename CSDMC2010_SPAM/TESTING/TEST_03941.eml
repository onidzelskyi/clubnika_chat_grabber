Bits from the Release Team
--------------------------

Release manager Adam Barrat sent Bits from the release team [25] which
gave an overview of the state of the upcoming release, Debian 6.0
"Squeeze". Adam admits that the situation is not as good as the release
team hoped, but that it is possible to release "Squeeze" in a few
months. He also gave a list of known transitions and asked people to
inform the release team about missing items. Regarding the timeline, he
asked all involved people to work hard, so a freeze in late May or June
would be possible. He concludes with some hints on how to help. Most
important is to fix release critical bugs or organise face-to-face
meetings to fix these. Andreas Barth laterblogged [26] a more detailed
list on how to help with the release.

Estimates of the number of Debian users
---------------------------------------

In the discussion about the upcoming elections for the Debian Project
Leader, Antony Towns [27] wondered how many users Debian has. Several
people discussed who is a "Debian user" and if users of Debian
derivatives would count, too. Another topic was how
accuratepopcon.debian.org [28] (a service where Debian users can report
anonymously what packages they have installed) reflects the number of
installations. Mike Hommey analysed [29] the installations reported for
xulrunner [30] (the rendering engine used by the Iceweasel browser) and
compared them to the hits of the page displayed after an upgrade.  He
came to the conclusion that for every one of the 13,000 Iceweasel
installations reported to popcon, there are at least 7.7 additional
Iceweasel installations, which do not have have popcon installed or
activated, while Simon Paillard found 1.5 million unique IP addresses
in the access logs of security.debian.org.

Bits from the DPL
-------------

Shortly before the end of his term Debian Project Leader Steve McIntyre
sent a "(Final) Bits from (this) DPL" [31]. He announced personnel
changes in several teams and mentioned some press contacts and their
outcome.  He also announced the availability of "Debian Certification"
for official Developers: "It seems that more and more companies are
keen to hire Debian folks, so it can be useful to have this kind of
documentation available." Steve also talked about suggestions made in
the last few months for ways to productively spend Debian money,
including funding of needed hardware and a large number of developer
meetings, as well as funding for the Debian Edu subproject, to help
them to continue their developer meetings into the future. He closed by
wishing the candidates of the current election good luck and is looking
forwards to having more time for some hacking.

New archive snapshot service available
--------------------------------------

A new service called http://snapshot.debian.org/ [32] has just been
announced [33]. snapshot.debian.org is a wayback machine that allows
access to old packages based on dates and version numbers. The ability
to install packages and view source code from any given date can be
very helpful to developers and users alike. It provides a valuable
resource for tracking down when regressions were introduced, or for
providing a specific environment that a particular application may
require to run. The snapshot archive is accessible like any normal apt
repository, allowing it to be easily used by all.

   32 : http://snapshot.debian.org/
   33 : http://www.debian.org/News/2010/20100412

The archive currently holds almost all packages from the main and
security archives since March 2005, as well as selected additional
archives like debian-volatile [34], debian-ports [35] and backports.org
[36]. This new service currently holds about 6.5 terabytes of data and
will grow constantly.

MiniDebConf held in Panama
--------------------------

More than 50 people participated recently in a MiniDebConf in Panama.
Starting March 20th and lasting two full days, the MiniDebConf touched
on a variety of subjects involving Debian with the participants sharing
their experiences with both Debian and Free Software. As Alejandro Rios
said [37]: "All this is possible thanks to several sponsors from Panama
and SPI, and the hard work from many people, specially Anto Recio,
Mauro Rosero, Carolina Flores, Gunnar Wolf and the local team." SPI is
Software in the Public Interest [38], a non-profit organisation which
was founded to help organisations develop and distribute open hardware
and software.

   37 : http://alerios-en.blogspot.com/2010_03_01_archive.html
   38 : http://www.spi-inc.org/

The MiniDebConf got quite technical, some of the subjects they covered
were: Packaging, Debian's Bug Tracking System, the Linux Kernel,
pbuilder and quilt.  There was also time for some socialising as there
was a visit to the Panama Canal as well as a group photo and apparently
some people even gathered to drink beer. Sounds to me like a successful
MiniDebConf. More info on Alejandro's blog. [39]

First German Debian Mini Conference
-----------------------------------

The Debian Project announced the first German Debian Mini Conference
[40] to be held on the 10th and 11th of June in Berlin. Embedded into
LinuxTag [41], one of the most important Open Source events in Europe,
it will feature two days of talks, workshops and panel discussions for
Debian Developers and Maintainers to contributors, users and otherwise
interested persons. In parallel to the conference, in a neighbouring
hacking area a Bug Squashing Party will be held.  Details are available
in the DebConf Wiki [42].

Graphical Installer for ARM-Based netbooks
------------------------------------------

Frans Pop blogged [43] about his work on porting Debian and the
debian-installer to ARM-based netbooks from ChiTech. After solving some
problems due to the limitations of the bootloader, he even managed to
get the X11 based graphical installer running on that device.

QEMU image for SH4 port available
---------------------------------

To make debugging of problems with the (unofficial) port to the SH4
architecture [44] easier, Aurelien Jarno provides [45] SH4 images to be
used with qemu [46]. The images have some limitations as they can only
use 64MB and need the current development version of qemu [47].

The role of the Debian ftpmasters
---------------------------------

lwn.net [49] published a lengthy article about the role of the Debian
ftpmasters [50] (article will be freely available from 15th April) and
their kind of unique position compared to other distributions. Based
upon explanations and a recent call for volunteers [51] from ftp-master
J=F6rg Jaspert, the article explains the duties and problems the ftp-team
is facing.

is possible to subscribe to changes in the list of people requesting
keysigning [58].

Sylvestre Ledru gave an update [60] about linear algebra libraries
(e.g. blas [61] and lapack [62]) in Debian, which are used by various
numerical programs in Debian (e.g. OpenOffice.org Calc [63]). He
emphasised how the packages deal with optimisation for different CPUs
(like SSE in different versions).

Release-critical bugs statistics for the upcoming release
---------------------------------------------------------

According to the unofficial RC-bugs count [66], the upcoming release,
Debian 6.0 "Squeeze", is currently affected by 445 release critical
bugs. 108 of them have already been fixed in Debian's "unstable"
branch. Of the remaining 337 release critical bugs, 53 already have a
patch (which might need testing) and 21 are marked as pending.

   66 : http://bts.turmzimmer.net/details.php

Ignoring these bugs as well as release critical bugs for packages in
contrib or non-free, 196 release critical bugs remain to be solved for
the release to happen.
