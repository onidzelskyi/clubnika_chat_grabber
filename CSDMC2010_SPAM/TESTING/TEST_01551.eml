Hey Dale,

This is a "problem" that is above Disk Arbitration.  You have to take =
this up with the Finder by filing a bug.  It seems to me that it was =
intentional.  I do not see this as a problem in practice, since a user =
will never have a chance to open the partition if you always mount it =
nobrowse.

With regards to the interpretation of nobrowse on 10.5, if it differs =
from 10.6, you may wish to consider other avenues.  You can use noauto =
in /etc/fstab to prevent the mount altogether, and only the mount the =
partition in question on demand.

How does a daemon that talks to Disk Arbitration solve that problem on =
such systems?

You have to understand that Disk Arbitration is what handles /etc/fstab. =
 You can think of /etc/fstab as prerecorded instructions to save you =
from writing a daemon to talk to Disk Arbitration.  This also solves the =
problem of internal volumes that mount before your daemon is even loaded =
at boot.  It is in fact a more robust solution, but you have not come to =
realize the disadvantages of a daemon yet.

I doubt that a daemon will solve this problem.  You will achieve the =
very same thing, which is to mount it nobrowse.  Finder is welcome to =
interpret that as it likes, even if it does not meet your expectations.  =
You can certainly try to see if it makes a difference, but I doubt it =
will be fruitful.

> /* guessing due to lack of sample code */


We have no sample code using Disk Arbitration 2, unfortunately.  We do =
with Disk Arbitration 1, but you will want to avoid it like the plague.  =
Disk Arbitration 2 does have HeaderDoc by contrast.  Note that the =
fundamentals of Core Foundation are covered elsewhere.
