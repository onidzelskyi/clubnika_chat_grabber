Oh--hang Father, drawled the indifferent little voice.

You're talking sound sense, Harry, said Happy Tom, an unexpected ally. I've several objections to this duel myself.  We'll need both of these men for the great battle with Hooker.  Arthur would be sure to wear his new uniform, and a bullet hole through it would go far toward spoiling it.  Besides, there's nothing to fight about.  And if they did fight, I'd hate to see the survivor standing up before one of Old Jack's firing squads and then falling before it.  You go to General Jackson, Harry, and I'll go along with you, seconding every word you say.  Shut up, Arthur; if you open your mouth again I'll roll you and your new uniform in the mud down there.  You know I can do it.

<title> With malign relish, Banneker looked up in the Sunday advertising the leading theater display, went to the musical comedy there exploited, and presently devoted a column to giving it a terrific and only half-merited slashing for vapid and gratuitous indecency. The play, which had been going none too well, straightway sold out a fortnight in advance, thereby attesting the power of the press as well as the appeal of pruriency to an eager and jaded public. Zucker left a note on the editorial desk warmly thanking his confrere for this evidence of cooeperation.

The bureaus Rabourdin and Baudoyer, after idling and gossiping since the death of Monsieur de la Billardiere, were now recovering their usual official look and the dolce far niente habits of a government office. Nevertheless, the approaching end of the year did cause rather more application among the clerks, just as porters and servants become at that season more unctuously civil. They all came punctually, for one thing; more remained after four o'clock than was usual at other times. It was not forgotten that fees and gratuities depend on the last impressions made upon the minds of masters. The news of the union of the two divisions, that of La Billardiere and that of Clergeot, under one director, had spread through the various offices. The number of the clerks to be retired was known, but all were in ignorance of the names. It was taken for granted that Poiret would not be replaced, and that would be a retrenchment. Little La Billardiere had already departed. Two new supernumeraries had made their appearance, and, alarming circumstance! they were both sons of deputies. The news told about in the offices the night before, just as the clerks were dispersing, agitated all minds, and for the first half-hour after arrival in the morning they stood around the stoves and talked it over. But earlier than that, Dutocq, as we have seen, had rushed to des Lupeaulx on receiving his note, and found him dressing. Without laying down his razor, the general-secretary cast upon his subordinate the glance of a general issuing an order.
