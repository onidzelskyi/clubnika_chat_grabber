Some of them, yes, I am on a first name basis with... but then  
virtually anyone can be too... they are all very friendly and  
helpful... once you contact them once, you'll be on first name basis  
with them.

None of the people nor organisations listed below were trade secrets.

Chuck posts to the AUGD list every week, as does Fred & Lynn... in  
fact both have posted their weekly announcements in the last hour or so
Sandy's email address is listed in each issue of the Apple User Group  
Bulletin each month... and now the AUGR team are too (well, they are  
just the Apple User Group Advisory Board)

The Apple Regional Liaisons have been listed on Apple's website for  
years.
The same with User Groups 'in your area'

The rest of the suggested list will be unique to every individual User  
Group

A while ago I posted a suggested list of Publicity Contacts that  
Australian Apple User Groups could utilise
It IS very Australian focused, but may give other User Groups more  
ideas on local organisations they can include on their own lists
