We all have different experiences, depending on what is loaded, and 
certainly sid has been fairly active in the last couple of months. I 
usually wait a week or so when a problem arises, during which time most 
of them disappear. When they don't it's usually because of a change of 
the structure of a package, and some old components must be removed to 
allow new components with different names to be installed.

Occasionally, it is even necessary to remove a vital package, and 
reinstate it either immediately after the now-successful upgrade, or do 
a bit more research into how to retain it. Sometimes, an upgrade really 
does conflict with a long-established package, and you have to decide 
which to keep. I have a feeling that recently happened with two 
different Flash viewers.

Do keep track of what you do, as I have just severely embarrassed myself 
by clearing such a logjam and then assuming that as nothing complained 
about dependencies, all was well. Some time later (weeks, I'm sure, and 
I had actually forgotten the conflict until seeing it on your list), a 
further upgrade to the package (mysql) stopped the daemon from starting, 
and I reported a bug, only to find a vital part of the system missing...

You don't run sid unless you have a sense of humour.
