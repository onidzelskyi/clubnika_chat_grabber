Hi Mike,

If you really care about KDE 3.5, I would suggest that you follow the
footstep of Mr. Marillat of Debian-multimedia [
http://debian-multimedia.org/ ]

Feel free to host the KDE 3.5 source and build server, and provide the
opportunity for KDE3.5 users to install it to their Debian computer by just
adding a single configuration line on /etc/apt/sources.list

If you see in the Debian-multimedia site, there are a lot of packages that
overlaps with the official Debian repository, but it does helps users (like
me) to use packages that are not really up to their liking in the official
repository.

Thanks.
