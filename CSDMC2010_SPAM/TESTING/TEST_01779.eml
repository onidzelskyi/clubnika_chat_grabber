This was sage advice, Jimmy. I had never used Synaptic much before, but the
local or obsleted tab in conjunction with searching dpkg -l is a boon.

In my case, it appears the root of the problems are caused by bitrot. I
probably need to come up with some method of rebuilding my sid boxes every
so often. Prior to this, my rebuilds were done in 2000 and 2007...Maybe if I
am going to run sid, I need to plan for an annual rebuild of the system...At
least the workstations...
