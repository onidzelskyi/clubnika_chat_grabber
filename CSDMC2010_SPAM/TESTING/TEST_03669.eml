Not quite true.  If the data in a sector was not readable, the sector=20
will be listed as "Pending".  Pending sectors are much worse than=20
Reallocated sectors, as Pending sectors mean lost data (if the sector=20
was in actual use, which SMART does not know -- and figuring out which=20
file might have been affected is, umm, tedious).

I keep SMART's Offline Surface Scan enabled on my drives, to have the=20
best chance that any failing sectors will be noticed early while they=20
can still be recovered.  I don't mind if there are a few Reallocated=20
sectors, as long as there are never any Pending sectors.  I'd mind if=20
the number of Reallocated sectors kept increasing.  Of course, I also=20
keep backups.

Or at least normally won't, unless Data Has Been Lost.

Agree.  Use smartctl.
