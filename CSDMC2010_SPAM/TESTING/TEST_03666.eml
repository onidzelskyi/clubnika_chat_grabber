No, it is a cheap generic USB mouse with no drivers whatsoever. It is very strange. I also tried another one, also without drivers, and it behaves in the same way (that is the middle click is interpreted as a LeaveNotify event). Of course before the update everything worked fine.

In another machine (running X11 under WindowMaker) the update was smooth without such problems. I am wondering if Gnome is to blame (but then Harald had not issues).

The ctrl-c and ctrl-v are obviously on the applications to handle, but they worked fine in Nedit before the update. Now they are also broken (I touched nothing else in the X11 installation, I only ran the XQuartz installer).

erm...  do you have some kind of 3rd party drivers installed for your mouse?  My guess is you have "middle click" mapped to something like "cycle through apps"

ctrl-c and ctrl-v are entirely on the applications to handle.  We just pass along those keypresses to whatever application you're running...
