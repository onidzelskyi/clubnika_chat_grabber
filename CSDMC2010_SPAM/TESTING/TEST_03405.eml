I have not installed Debian on this *particular* machine, but I have had 
some experience in general.


Netbooks are underpowered.  Get a *real* notebook/laptop.  You can get a 
much better computer for about the same money.  The only advantage I can 
see in a netbook is battery life.  I speak from experience.

I have briefly had Linux installed on an Eee PC.  It performs better in 
some ways, but I saw no real advantage other than the usual advantages 
that Linux has over Win/Mac.

At the time, I struggled with drivers.  That situation has probably 
improved.

My Eee PC's Atom CPU is single-core, 32-bit.  This is appropriate 
because the machine cannot support more than 2GB of RAM anyway, and it 
is never used for anything except "net" things:  web+email.

64-bit is overkill for a netbook.  If you get a "real" machine, 64-bit 
might be useful.  But for netbook-class machines, save your money.

MAA
