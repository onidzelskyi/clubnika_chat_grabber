I'd characterize it as a combination of principle and curiosity. I 
really want to see how well I can accomplish what I want to do and what 
I need to do using only FOSS. I'm relatively new to GNU/Linux, but I've 
had very few problems that were at all difficult to resolve. Come to 
think of it, the only problems that were absolutely indomitable were 
caused by the use of non-free software / drivers in my earlier forays 
into the various distributions. I guess those experiences have 
strengthened my resolve to stick with FOSS.

I have to admit that GoogleEarth would be a nice thing to have.

Jim
