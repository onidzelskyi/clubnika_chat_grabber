yes I know this, what I was trying to say was that, it I start the laptop up
with the lid closed and the external monitor attached my console comes up on
the external monitor
I would like to find a linux cli or gui app that will let me set it back

yes I have a fn that is supposed to do it, but doesn't - only way to press
the key combo is with the lid up.  I think you are too hung up on the
external keyboard - or maybe I have given enough info.


let me try again.

attach laptop to external monitor, leave laptop open
turn on laptop, it boots into X, which is setup to have external monitor and
laptop monitor, one above the other.

Console is on the exterenal monitor

remove external monitor

I can reconfigure X with xrandr so that my display is only on the laptop -
work well

but when I go to tty1 or 2-6, its not there and pressing fn+fx to switch
screens isn't working.

I was hoping that there would be a tool to do it from the command line -
something I could do before removing the external monitor.

we have tools to grab the vga info vbetool.

presume all the above is done with out external keyboard :)
