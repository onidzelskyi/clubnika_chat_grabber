Given the 12" screens and full size laptop keyboards on the current dual
core netbooks I'd hardly call them "netbooks", but rather small laptops, or,
gasp, "sub notebooks".  It wasn't all that long ago that the average laptop
had a 12" screen.  Given the trend of constant growth and bloat of laptops...

Playing prophet, I predict that in the not too distant future the hw makers
will introduce a "new" class of portable computers called "sub netbooks"
which will start out with the 7" screen that the first "netbooks" were
introduced with, because all the netbooks will have crept up to 10" or 12"
screens.

This industry is famous for taking the old and relabeling it as new in an
attempt to drive revenue, but with almost zero innovation in the "new".
