I have already forwarded them to the list and would gladly send them on to =
you=20
if you were to ask me to do so.  But list policy is to stay on list unless=
=20
requested to do otherwise. ;-)

The last one in particular was personal, rude and unpleasant.  He is not=20
simply=20
<quote>

He is doing that, but in addition he is bullying people most unpleasantly i=
f=20
they do not do his bidding.  I do not use KDE 4 and have no wish to do so.=
=20

The only thing I could have done differently (other than not send that very=
=20
short and mild complaint) is bow down to Dotan and agree that I have no rig=
ht=20
to dislike KDE 4, because he does not find my reasons valid.  I tried to en=
d=20
this by simply not replying, but even that did not rescue me - he sent=20
another email, to which I again did not reply.  What more could I do, other=
=20
than be very rude myself, to make him go away?

I do not have to give him reasons for my dislike.  I dislike KDE 4 and do n=
ot=20
use it.  That is surely my right?  I dislike fennel.  No-one tries to=20
force-feed me with it!

And surely I have no duty to help Dotan in his single minded ambition to=20
impose KDE 4 on all the world?  Many of us do not use it.  Several people=20
have been very helpful in sending me comments (_on_ list) on other=20
possibilities. =20

If he is truly doing what he is doing from altruistic motives, then surely =
he=20
must only "help" (help????) those who want his help, not bully those who=20
don't.
