Please don't pander.  I am well aware of the above as I also develop a
bit of Free Software that is in Debian.

"Problem"?  Sorry, no problem with Debian here from me.  How you have 
inferred such is interesting as I've made no comment regarding the
Debian KDE package team and their decisions (noting well that the team
has almost no choice but to package what upstream makes available as
current code).  I'm making comments about one version of KDE versus 
another which is the same regardless of the distribution.

Sorry, bub, but you have me confused with someone else.  I am not
engaging in a rant of any sort but have merely stated my observations
from using various versions of KDE and how it works or doesn't *for me*
(I've noted that several times in this thread, in fact).  The fact that 
you obviously dislike reading my opinion doesn't mean I have to listen 
to you telling me to shut up about it.

>   * contribute and change the situation

As a small time dev myself I can tell from that statement that you are
not one as that is the fastest way to discourage contribution from the
users of your software.  Any dev that does believe that is on the fast
track to irrelevancy,

> That's just IMHO.

Funny, my comments have been strictly about the software.  Your comments
have been strictly about *me*.  Interesting...
