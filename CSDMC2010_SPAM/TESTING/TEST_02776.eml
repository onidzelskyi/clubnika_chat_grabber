Hello,

may I followup this thread, despite being off-topic, in the hope to
find technically savvy people giving good advice...  :-)


(1)  Does it make sense to upgrade Tiger to Leopard running on a
G4-PowerBook-12" laptop?

In contrast to above I am not forced to do it at all, even more so
because on this marvellous machine all has worked very well as it
already is;  and I am definitely not going to do the transition if
this could mean any loss in performance.

Otherwise I would probably upgrade, mostly because of QTKit which in
Leopard includes

    QTCaptureSession

which seems to provide a simple method to access video cameras
(IIDC-firewire or usb-webcams) for video capturing purposes if
comparing to QTKit on Tiger (at least I've got an impression this
stuff being pretty/very tricky there).


(The downside means moving away from XFree-X11 which has proven
exceptionally solid too.)



(2)  I am considering to install a second CPU into a current 4-core
Xeon MacPro (as one processor socket is still empty).  Local Apple
guys say this is not supposed to be done (in particular because of
some heating problems which could arise then etc), but I cannot see
if this is simply a "salesman's talk" while trying selling a
completely new machine instead.  Though having 8 cores in total
makes more computational (... and financial) sense as to buy a
machine of today with, e.g. 6 cores.

Is there anything of substance known in these supposed heating issues?

Huge thanks in advance for any hint,

    Eeri Kask
