Interestingly, if I grab the applet window, I get the clipped applet display stretched to fit the size of the entire applet window.  If I grab the firefox window, I just get the firefox window display.  I guess this makes sense since the applet runs in a separate process, though I don't understand why the applet display is getting messed up.  Maybe this is a clue to where the problem lies.

We have made a considerable amount of progress on Plugin2 since "Java for Mac OS X 10.6 Update 1" has been shipped, and I think you'll find the experience with Plugin2 much more usable with this preview of "Java for Mac OS X 10.6 Update 2".

Isn't Firefox a Cocoa app?
