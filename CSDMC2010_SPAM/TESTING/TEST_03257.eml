Sure, but I am not here on a laptop, and I use an Nvidia GeForce
FX5700. Okay, this is pretty bad for a video card, but it should cope
with such videos.

DVDs play nicely. It works better with MPEG-1 videos, 30 fps. That is, there
is a lag of ~1 sec. if I go to some specified time in the video. It
works best (i.e. no perceptible lag) with XVID MPEG-4. FLV works
nicely too. Quicktime (.mov) is nice too.

It works pretty bad with Microsoft Windows Media 9 and .mkv.

Ok.
