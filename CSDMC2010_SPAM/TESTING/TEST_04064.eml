Thanks for the tip.  That may be an option.  I looked at the documentation
online, and there does not appear to be an option equivalent to lilo's
vga option, though, which I use a lot, especially since svgatextmode
has already been pulled from squeeze.  As of right now, if lilo was
pulled from the distribution, I think I'd be inclined to build my own
lilo package from source before switching to any other bootloader.
To the best of my knowledge, it is the *only* bootloader which supports
setting an initial text video mode *and* does not use any sectors outside
the master boot record and outside of a partition.  If I'm wrong about
that, someone please correct me.

As for a "convenient configuration system", editing a plain text
file is plenty good enough for me.  Your time is yours
to use as you see fit; but if you have the requisite skills to become
the equivalent of lilo upstream, I think there's a lot of people
who would rather that you do that, myself included.  I'd do it myself
if I had the necessary skills and knowledge.  But I don't.

Thanks again for the tip.
