I struggled with NetBeans 6.8 for days in a sort of love/hate =
relationship.  When it works it's an excellent tool, but often it was =
agonizingly slow and would run out of memory.  Using the built-in =
snapshot tool I was able to see that there was a lot of file access =
driven my Mercurial.  It turns out that I had an .hg directory in my =
home directory (can't remember putting it there or ever using it).  Even =
though all of my projects were in sub-directories the NetBeans Mercurial =
plug-in insisted on scanning everything under my home directory.  This =
used 100% of the CPU and eventually all the  memory shortly after =
starting up NetBeans.  After getting rid of the .hg subdirectory =
everything is groovy.

I don't know if you're using Mercurial with NetBeans or not, but if so =
this could be the problem.  If not, NetBeans might be doing a similarly =
crazy thing to cause your problem.
