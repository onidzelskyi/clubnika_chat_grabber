Sorry for stepping on your toes there, buddy. You can have your thread

I'm a Debian user, helping other users. I ask on the Ubuntu list when
appropriate and I ask on the Debian list when appropriate. Other than
this pointless thread, I do not post such off topic nonsense and
everything I ask here is applicable to Debian. I do not ask about the
Ubuntu installer or wallpaper.

Thank you, that's me.

Thanks for being so generous. I thoroughly abuse those archives, don't
worry. I post only when my question is not answered there.


>=C2=A0But don't post here unless you

If you haven't noticed, exactly what I am doing is learning how Debian
systems work in order to help others.


>=C2=A0I'm not trying to be unkind. =C2=A0I have nothing
> against you personally.

I know, you did not attack me personally. I'm not sensitive, don't
worry! Some idiot on the kde-usability list did attack me personally
just yesterday, and I simply asked "why the personal attack" but in
this case I understand that your frustration is aimed at Ubuntards
dragging down the Debian list, not Dotan Cohen.


>=C2=A0But it is not fair for you to run another OS and

I disagree that I am:
1) running another OS
-or-
2) coming over here asking for free help

I ask Debian-related questions, and make an effort to learn. I then
apply that knowledge to help users of a Debian-based distro. I'm not
the one ruining your list, I promise.


>=C2=A0This is not a forum for users

> Period.
>

I therefore ask only Debian-related questions, and even then only
after extensively searching tfa and stfw. Where I apply that knowledge
is irrelevant.
