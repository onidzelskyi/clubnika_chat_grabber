Thanks Allen

Incidentally, it turns out that Quicktime 10 / File / New Movie =
Recording DOES let the iSight camera see the iPad without the mirroring =
we suffered with using iChat.  The green button expands the image

You don=92t have to record, (although you could), but it works to the =
extent you can put the iSight camera on the iPad
