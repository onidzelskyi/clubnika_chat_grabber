Are you setting an icon on the window? We previously had a bug in Java 6 =
where we were inadvertently ignoring the icon that was set on the =
heavyweight window components, and when we fixed it we got a bunch of =
angry bugs about how "my window's Dock icon looks like crap!", because =
they were setting some low-res art as the window's icon for other =
platforms.

Just a thought...I haven't tested this scenario yet. Even if you don't =
have a simple example that reproduces the problem, if you can send us a =
copy of your app via <http://bugreporter.apple.com> and some steps to =
reproduce, we should be able to quickly determine what the issue is.
