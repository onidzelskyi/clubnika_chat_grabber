while I understand the frustration I have also known MUGs which were =
seriously dysfunctional and embarrassing to be part of. I can see why =
Apple don't wish to promote a link with them, because they can't always =
rely on it. All you need is a bad list-moderator and a couple of =
nutters, and you have a list which all the right people leave.
