I am writing for the desktop using Cocoa's BT objects. I would love to  
get this app on the iPhone but jailbreaking appears to be the only  
option.

My model over BT is remote procedure calls. That is why I need a  
dedicated thread for acquiring and signaling results.

"Blocking" is an ambiguous term. If an event on the main thread calls  
a function, it is blocking. The low level private implementation  
detail of a function interacting with BT is irrelevant  to the fact  
that the main run loop calls a getter on a model object. I have  
policies built in for timeouts.

Some of these getters are computed from the results of multiple BT  
remote procedure calls. The main thread calls the procedural getters.  
In one connection implementation, BT, it uses another thread to sync  
the results.

I would recomend allowing the client of your library to select the  
thread. Auto injection into global state is a limiting side-effect.  
RPC becomes very difficult.

So back to CocoaTouch - can your code go into an AppStore product?
