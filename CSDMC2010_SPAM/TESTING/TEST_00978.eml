In a literal sense, absolutely correct. There has been a move afoot to
change the nomenclature to "Apple User Groups." I confess that I tend to
use MUG as (1) a convenience convention and (2) because I have a web
site called "The MUG Center." 

:)


>>

>
>Well yeah, sort of. A bit simplistic, but sure.

The non-profit model is one model; there are others, and I seriously
doubt that there is one "best" for everyone.

I'd

I think there are two different views of user groups in this
conversation: the raison d'etre of the group, and the mechanics of how
the group functions. Dave described the former and Mike the later...and
both are pretty much correct.

AMEN, but did you *have* to pick Hannah Montana as your example=3F  ;-)

Interesting comments, guys, but do you really feel it matters=3F Both are
**Apple** teams, exist at Apple's pleasure, and are structured as it
sees fit. They hold no authority over your groups. Apple doesn't license
user groups. They do "recognize* groups who meet certain qualifications,
which get those groups a listing on the locator.

In short, there is no reason those teams should be democratically
assembled, any more than contributors to The MUG Center should be
elected. Different models for different goals, just like Mike's group
vs. Dave's group.

Don't know about you, but I'm enjoying this thread. Great exchange of ideas.
