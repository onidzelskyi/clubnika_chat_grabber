If I may jump into...

Probably he means about having your two movies perfectly in sync
with some code.

Actually this is on what I've been since this morning and what I
found :

If you start your two movies approximatively at the same time
does not mean they are going to start in sync.

It might not be easy to see though. a way I found to ensure
that I'm in sync is to play 2 exact same movie with sound.
if you can ear a phasing effect, then the two movies are not
in sync, otherwise you may assume that they are in sync.

Tracks in a movie get synchronized when you start a movie, however
doing the same on several movies is different. After some searches
I've found some sample code : "LiveVideoMixer3". To see my point
above you'll have to comment line 136 of VideoChannel.m (to enable
sound) then you'll have to change line 275 of LiveVideoMixerController.m
to :
TimeBase mtb = masterTimeBase;
in that case you can load 2 times the same movie and see that they
are perfectly in sync.
Looking around in the code you can figure out that the first video
feed the time base for the others, which does the trick, and which
I think was the meaning of "tweening code".

Also I discovered the following. I needed to put several movies
in sync, but could not rely on one movie to exist. So I thought
I could make some kind of base movie which would be the master
of the other dynamically allocated movies.

If I do a NewMovie (0), I can use this movie as the time base
for the other movies.
What is interesting here, is that the clock of this new empty
movie is a micro seconds one and not a sample one. (the sample
one is the one you find when you get a video with sound).
A bug on that particular feature was reported on this list
some time ago but it seems to be ok now.
(if someone can confirm that last part, that would make me glad,
ie does it always work, is there some drift, etc.)

Hope this will help,

Raphael
