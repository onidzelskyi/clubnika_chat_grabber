btw, after some testing, I also notice that if I set the high quality  
flag in QT Player Pro 7, and compare the movie to the same movie  
viewed in QT Player 10 (now with the high quality flag set), the movie  
is still considerably sharper in QT Player 7. Kind of disappointing,  
unless I'm missing something.

The reason we need the high-quality flag is that students edit in FCP  
or FCE and want to show rough cuts, easy by going to  
File>Export>QuickTime movie, without worrying about all the codec  
settings. But then the movie looks fuzzy on playback, with only half  
the vertical resolution.
Lots of our movies are still captured and edited using the DV codec,  
by students on their own Mac laptops now.
