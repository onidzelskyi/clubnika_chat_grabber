Just in case you are running grub2, the /etc/grub/default variables
for framebuffer are
GRUB_TERMINAL=gfxterm
GRUB_GFXMODE=<resolution>
GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX=[<resolution|keep>]

There used to be a warning about using "vga=<resolution>" as a
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT or GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX option (it seems to
have been removed or my eyes are too slow to see it) and advice to use
GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD, but the latter has now been superceded by the above
payload variable.

Do you still have this font-color problem if you comment out
GRUB_GFXMODE and GRUB_GFXPAYLOAD_LINUX and set "GRUB_TERMINAL=console"
(and reboot after running "update-grub")?
