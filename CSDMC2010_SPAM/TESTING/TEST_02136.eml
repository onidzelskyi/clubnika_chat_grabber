You seem to not like either to keep things simple or Debian and KDE. So 
why don't you switch to other rpm based distros that have the packages 
that you want? All this discussion about what you don't like in Debian 
and in KDE is not really meaningful and BTW I don't know of any open 
source driver that can't be compiled in Debian for any kernel. If it's 
closed source, then again: use the distro that is compatible with the 
package format with which the drivers are provided. Just a personal 
thought on this topic: it seems very odd that a driver compiled for a 
kernel running on a completely different distro, can run on a Debian 
kernel too. Are you sure that you are doing things in the right way?
Bye
