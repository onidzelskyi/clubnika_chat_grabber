When I run this code in Mac OS X 10.5, it works fine. However, when I =
run it in 10.6, the java process hangs, and the system doesn't go to =
sleep until the 30 timeout occurs. Upon resume, the java process seems =
permanently hung up and non-responsive. Any ideas why this would occur?

I'd actually recommend having your static function post a Runnable onto =
the AWT EventQueue with SwingUtilities.invokeLater(), and return =
immediately.

Best of luck,
