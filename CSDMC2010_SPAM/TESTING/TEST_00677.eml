You know, I said the same thing, but then as the kernel and GRUB and the
like advanced, I noticed that my reiserfs partitions would have to replay
the journal every time I rebooted, even after a clean shutdown. I started
calculating how many times I shrunk any of my partitions in the last 8
years, and I can only recall twice. And since I have several terabytes
around the house, I figure I can migrate data and delete/recreate partitions
if I really need to reduce it.

I might play with it for some non-critical partitions, or ones that I can
mirror on an established filesystem, even if it is only to use in an
"Archive Island" scenario, where I have a LV that I can mount, sync and
umount. However, btrfs is not included in the kernel, is it? As I recall,
nilfs2 has kernel support, but that was the only one of the new filesystems,
at the time when I started looking at this.

That is enough to give me pause...
