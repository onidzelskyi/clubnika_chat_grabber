Well, whilst myself I do not consider this really important, I would =
definitely not use this wording. IMHO the statement is, quite =
contrariwise, considerably less precise than desirable for good =
documentation.

The former sentence seems to me quite seriously misleading, for it =
strongly hints there are some cases when sending to nil might bring ill =
effects. That's patently wrong. Do please correct me if I am overlooking =
something, but I believe in ObjC you can _always_ send a message to nil =
with no ill effects altogether -- far as I know, this does work in =
absolutely all cases without one sole exception (and always did). Thus, =
"often" should definitely be cut out (or even replaced by "always").

Now, using the return value is of course a different kettle of fish. The =
latter sentence is not that bad by far, but it still slightly hints that =
non-object return values won't work. IMHO, something like "Return values =
from messages sent to nil are guaranteed to work in some cases, one of =
which is whenever what is returned is typed as an object" or similar =
would help newbies better to understand the thing.

Best,
