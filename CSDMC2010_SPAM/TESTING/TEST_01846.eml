This is a rather clumsy way these days.  Why don't you use pdflatex?

The changes in the file seem to confuse acroread.  At least it does not
crash.

A smart reader would have an option to detect changes to the file and
reload it automatically.  Since I haven't used acroread for ages I don't
know whether it has such an option.

A quick experiment shows that this does not seem to be the case, ps2pdf
writes to the existing file.

Ask Adobeâ€¦

I would be rather annoyed if a reader locked a file that it does not
even open for writing.
