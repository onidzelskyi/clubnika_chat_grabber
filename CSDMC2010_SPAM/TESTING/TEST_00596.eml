Ah. So you (want to) provide synchronous RPC over BT. We did provide =
synchronous BT calls in BTnut (btnode.ethz.ch), but so far I don't plan =
on adding such a feature to BTstack.

Thanks for the suggestion. Not convinced yet, but I guess we should this =
discuss this over at the BTstack-dev mailing list :)

Let's say it is not impossible. An application that uses BTstack can run =
inside the usual Sandbox. The client library currently is a dylib but =
there is no reason to not just link it statically. However, to work, =
BTdaemon (which implements the Bluetooth stack) needs to be installed =
and running, which is only possible with jailbreak. So, I in theory an =
app in the AppStore could use BTstack, but only on a jailbroken device, =
which might make the AppStore review a bit awkward.   ... See you on the =
BTstack list :)
