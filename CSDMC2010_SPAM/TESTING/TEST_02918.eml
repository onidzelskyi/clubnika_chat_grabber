> I'm not trying to load an instance of the class, I'm trying to load =
the actual class definition.  The error is telling me that the Java =
ClassLoader can't find that class on the classpath (at least that's my =
understanding).  What I don't understand is, for it to have called the =
static initializer, that means Java has already loaded the class =
definition, right?  So why can't it find it?

There may be a java.lang.Class object that exists in the Java heap, but =
that doesn't mean that the ClassLoader has a reference to it until after =
it's static{} block returns. Classes that are not done initializing =
should not be accessible. If you need the instance of the class object, =
you should rewrite your JNI function to take a java.lang.Class =
parameter, and explicitly pass MyAwesomeClass.class to it.

I'd also recommend you take a look at the JavaNativeFoundation.framework =
if you are going to be mixing Java and Cocoa a lot. It's got lots of =
handy functions and macros for handling things like autorelease pools, =
translating between Java exceptions and NSExceptions, and =
attaching/detaching threads from the JVM.
