Isn't that what this discussion is about? Maybe long winded yes, but there
are ideas here. You might not like them, but no reason to not be tolerant of
them.

Well, I have. And perhaps others too. Not every topic on these lists will be
of interest for everyone, but for some they are.

I'd love to hear your ideas on what you are doing to "keep the energy level
up" in your group.
