Objective-C is a specific object extension of the C language based on Smalltalk, not a generic moniker to cover other C-based OO languages like C++ (based on Simula, which was a much nicer more modern language). Objective-C is a very different beast to C++, although there is Objective-C++ where you can mix the languages to some extent (for porting, etc - in general you would not mix in C++ code with Obj-C code in a new app).

As to the original (non-language based) question, you can drive another Mac with keyboard and mouse, just by connecting to it with Screen share - works across applications. I'll assume there's something more that you want to do that you'll have to program the same thing for yourself. If you can (your app isn't too secret), you should also post a higher-level description of what you really want to do. In the Mac world we call this "Think Different"!
