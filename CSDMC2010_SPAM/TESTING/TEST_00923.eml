In this case, the client had a Ricoh MP W3600 plotter although, if I
recall correctly, we had the same problem with all the printers - it was
just more obvious with the plotter.  Let's say they wanted to send a
24x36 drawing to the plotter.  If they send it through any of the FOSS
PDF viewers, it prints a 24x36 job but the image is always the default
paper size, i.e., the drawing would be reduced to 8.5x11 and printed in
the middle of a 24x36 piece of paper.  In some cases, we sent two pages
per side - reducing and rotating the drawings to fit two per page.  In
this case, two 8.5x11 images appeared on the large sheet!

Acroread is not without flaws either.  Versions previous to 9.3.2 could
not see our CUPS print server's printers.  9.3.2 can see them but,
whenever it prints, it sends the default page region.  Thus, if I
directly choose, say this 3600 plotter, and send a 36x48 drawing, I see
acroread has created a print job with -o PageSize=3D36x48 but also with -o
PageRegion=3DA4 (or whatever either the ppd default is or the first
PageRegion listed in the ppd if no default is defined).  We've seen the
same thing when trying to send 11x17 jobs to other printers - it prints
Letter size (or whatever the default PageRegion is).  We've escalated to
Ricoh but this really smells like an acroread bug.
