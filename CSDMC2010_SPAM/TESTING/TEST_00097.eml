Looking forward to your jigsaw talk :-)

Indeed. I learned scala because I found about it through Debian :-)
I'm CC:ing the Scala maintainers to see if they feel like giving a
talk. (Groovy and clojure are Debian-Java maintained so the
maintainers should be getting this already.)

Alternatively, we can have a JVM-based languages BoF session. If
anybody is interested in the topic, please submit it before the
deadline (in three days).

(that thread looks very good, I'll read it at a later time, thanks for
pointing to it)

with respect to other distros, yes, in that area the Eclipse packaging
is heavily based on the work of Linux Tools in Eclipse, with a number
of people from Red Hat, so it is nice if we can identify things we do
to return the favor ;-)

Does anybody has experience using java tooling in other distros and
will be willing to sign up for a talk on the subject?

We recently had issues with duplicated code in bsh [2]. Maybe there're
people in Debian-Security with particular expertise to Java that'd
like to give a talk (or a joint talk)?

Again, the deadline for talks is soon so go for it :-)
