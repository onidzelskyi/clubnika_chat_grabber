I also share an affinity for giving presentations via PDF (I create the
slides in Pages and then export).

But that won't work with the iPad and the external display connector.  Using
Keynote for iPad would be necessary to use that output.

The pdf viewer app for the phone OS does not support the video output,
according to this:

http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4108

Note that there is an error in that apple tech document.  It says that 720p
is the scan rate.  720 is a resolution, not a scan rate.  60 hertz, 70
hertz, 75 hertz, etc. are scan rates.

Every time I post a message to this list I'm going to post a request for
REPLY TO to be changed to Augd@lists.apple.com.  That's how mailing lists
should work for the benefit of group discussion.
