At the command line, you can start/stop service like this:

(as root):

/etc/init.d/someservice stop
/etc/init.d/someservice start

There is also the invoke-rc.d command, which works similarly, but I
don't use that so I'm not really qualified to recommend it.

Note that there are other parameters besides stop and start.  Two that
come to mind are "restart" and "reload".

Tab completion can be handy when stopping/starting services.  Type:

/etc/init.d/x   -- and then hit tab.  

You may have to hit tab twice.
Hitting tab will either complete the command that starts with "x", or if
multiple commands start with "x", hitting tab twice will show you a list
of those commands.  

Good luck in your quest for learning.
