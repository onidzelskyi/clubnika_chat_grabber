Hi!

I had terrible issues with Snow Leopard and NetBeans 6.7.1, particularly =
doing Swing Apps. I had to do what you did, reinstalling Java 5 (An =
unsupported procedure).

NetBeans traced the bug in Apple JVM, and after NetBeans 6.8 came out =
with some workarounds for the Matisse development environment, =
everything  became usable, at least to me. So I switched completely to =
Java 6.

http://netbeans.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3D173912

I am using Snow Leopard, Java 6, 32 bits, with 2 GiB RAM. I have not had =
mayor issues, however, I do not like the rendering (font and graphics) =
in Swing in Java 6, it looks fuzzier than Java 5.

David
