Remo Software has published an interesting article on how to
recover lost photos using the company?s REMO Recover (Mac) --
Media Edition software. The software serves to recover accidentally
deleted, lost digital photos, audio and video files from camera
memory cards, USB drives and other flash memory storage devices.

iPhone Credit Card Devices

Last fall, Apple introduced their Easy Pay system based on an iPod
touch that scans bar codes and reads credit card magnetic strips.
Many customers are amazed by the ease of use and wonder
if it is iPhone based.

http://www.ugnn.com/2010/05/iphone-credit-card-devices/

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Affordable Mac Alternatives for Adobe CS5

Bambi Brannan wrote two articles on alternatives to Adobe Creative
Suite. The firs dealt with alternatives for Fireworks and Illustrator.
But the article that got my attention was strictly on
alternatives to Photoshop.

Mac User Groups going the way of the Newton

THREE YEARS AGO :
Justin Berka, in his column Infinte Loop at arstecnica.com talks
about the decline and eventual death of compuer user groups in
general and Macintosh user groups specifically.

Still true today?

Twitter Phishing Attack

DO NOT CLICK Since last week, we?ve been tracking, analyzing and
reporting a phishing attack on Twitter users. This attack demonstrates
how many of the Twitter accounts have been hijacked and turned
intovehicles for cyber criminals.

Six Unintended iPad Careers

You?ve just bought an iPad. Maybe you?re holding it now, reading
this article on it. Maybe it?s still on order. Either way, now that
the iPad is an actual, hold-able, own-able device, and no longer
a unicorn concept, we thought we?d get you up-to-speed on some
of the possible upcoming ?unintended? job opportunities sure
to come about from the adoption of this magical new device.

Fighting the good fight

For over ten years UGN has brought news, views, reviews, warnings
and alerts about your digital safety, and the world of online safety.
And, you?ve come to recognize our ?Don?t Click? and ?No Spam? buttons
around the web. But there is still a real need to educate your
members, friends, family and business community.

One good way of doing this is with the ?Don?t Click? button.

Please show this button on your web site, and link to your favorite
anti-spam site. Help fight cyber crime by buying, showing and
giving away the Don't Click buttons

Help support our efforts by getting a button and showing it off.
Groups can buy the ?micro? button in bulk for around a dollar, and
include it in promotions and new member kits. This way you?re spreading
the word to be careful online
? while supporting your UGN at the same time.

You might be responsible for saving someone from
becoming a cyber crime victim!

Quote:  I don't have time

"Don't say you don't have enough time.
    You have exactly the same  number of hours per day
      that were given to Helen Keller, Pasteur,
       Michaelangelo, Mother Teresa, Leonardo da Vinci,
        Thomas Jefferson,  and Albert Einstein."
