Thank you for such an excellent response.  I was going to comment that
Squeeze and Sid are more stable than many distributions but they still
have their issues.  We had very much wanted to use Squeeze for a
potentially large but enterprise class deployment.  After considerable
testing, we opted for Lenny + backports + the occasional adaptation from
Squeeze where absolutely necessary.

Most of our postponement of Squeeze was due to KDE 4.x which seemed an
excellent idea but not yet ready for enterprise use and we even tested
using Gnome but found there were other issues.  Again, thanks for an
excellent response which I'm sure took some time to craft - John
