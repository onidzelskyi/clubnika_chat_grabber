Hi,

Two weeks ago my mail client (alpine) stopped authenticating my email 
provider's certificate.  (Provider is FastMail.fm.)

I tried several things (details below) without success.
I can't even tell if the problem is on my or server's end.
I tried to get help at the provider's forum's to no avail.

** Please help in anaylzing this situation **

Here are the details.

+ The failure message
   "There was a failure validating the \
    SSL/TLS certificate for the server
        mail.messagingengine.com
    The reason for the failure was
        unable to get local issuer certificate"

+ I use alpine both at home and work.  Failure occurs only at work.
   But work machine was OK until 2 weeks ago.

+ Both machines run gnu-linux debian stable (lenny), using the
   latest version of alpine (1.10+dfsg-3).

+ After the problems started at work I noted that there is a
   mismatch between the versions of libkrb53 on home and work
   machines.  (Alpine depends on libkrb53.)  Specifically, work
   machine was fully updated, while home machine had a pending
   security update.
   (At the moment I refrain from doing the update on home machine
   -- don't want to lose working setup without further advice.)

+ running
       'strace alpine ... | grep cert'
   on home machine reveals that alpine uses
       /usr/lib/ssl/certs/ed524cf5.0,
   which is symlinked to
       Entrust.net_Secure_Server_CA.pem.

+ On work machine (again using strace) alpine looks for
       /usr/lib/ssl/certs/9e233d61.0
   which does not exist on my system.
   (On the other hand, the file accessed on home machine
       /usr/lib/ssl/certs/ed524cf5.0
   does exist on work machine, too.)

+ I thought that symlinking the file that works on home machine
       /usr/lib/ssl/certs/ed524cf5.0
   to what alpine is looking for
       /usr/lib/ssl/certs/9e233d61.0
   would help.
   But it didn't :-((

+ I tried to extract the certificate directly from the
   client/server exchange, and use it as a symlink to what work
   machine is looking for.  Without success :-((
   The recipe I used was here:
       http://www.madboa.com/geek/pine-ssl/#summary

+ Accessing the mail via web browser is OK (both work & home).

Thank you in advance,
Itay
