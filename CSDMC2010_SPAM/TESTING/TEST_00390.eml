Good question. I now use Google Chrome 5.0.375.38 beta exclusively.
I loaded it down from their site. Is there a debian package?

Pro's:

1. I also feel it is more responsive than IW .
2. I like the screen layout better.
3. The extension development process is well documented, but I have 
never looked at that with IW.
4. I like the project, a nice competitor for IE, hope it clobbers it ;-)

Con's:
1. How do you know when there is a new version? I got it from:
http://www.google.com/chrome?platform=linux
but that doesn't have the version number.
2. The bookmark manager is a mess: no way to go to the bottom of the 
list other than using the slide-bar on the right and who knows where he 
imported the IW bookmarks from, but the ain; t the ones I am using now...
3. Some of the keyboard shortcuts don't work, notable forwards 
(shift+backspace) and backwards (backspace)
4. Those are issues 
http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=22683&q=backspace&colspec=ID%20Stars%20Pri%20Area%20Feature%20Type%20Status%20Summary%20Modified%20Owner%20Mstone%20OS
and
http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=22771&q=backspace&colspec=ID%20Stars%20Pri%20Area%20Feature%20Type%20Status%20Summary%20Modified%20Owner%20Mstone%20OS
and when do they get resolved?
5. On IW you can setup autoscroll, but in chrome not.

I'll update the list when I think of more items.
