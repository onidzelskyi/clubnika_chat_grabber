No version of Java for Mac OS X provided by Apple has X11 support. Third =
party JVMs like SoyLatte and OpenJDK do however (it's their only AWT =
support).

We do have feature requests to add X11 support, however it's a very =
large change that would need careful thought put into how to integrate =
side-by-side support and how to switch between the two toolkits. If such =
a change were to be integrated, it would likely only happen in a major =
Java version bring-up.
