No unless you want to list all KDE SC 4.4 binary packages in=20
/etc/apt/preferences (one entry for each package, 400+ in total).

Never pin whole experimental higher than unstable.

Therefore you should tweak aptitude in such a way that the first solution=20
would be the one you want.

In order to upgrade existing KDE 4.3.4 installation, something like this=20
should work (untested):

# aptitude -t experimental install '?maintainer(Debian Qt/KDE=20
Maintainers)~Aexperimental~i'

or (a safer version):

# aptitude -o 'Aptitude::ProblemResolver::Hints::experimental=3Dapprove=20
~Aexperimental' install '?maintainer(Debian Qt/KDE=20
Maintainers)~Aexperimental~i'/experimental

=46or new installations:

# aptitude -t experimental install kde-standard

or (safer version):

# aptitude -o 'Aptitude::ProblemResolver::Hints::experimental=3Dapprove=20
~Aexperimental' install kde-standard/experimental

You should not run into much troube unless there are packages with=20
unresolvable dependencies installed.

> Conclusion: I'm not able create a KDE 4.4.2 LiveCD at this point :-/

It has never been easy to deal with experimental because it is a dumping=20
ground for lots stuff and typically only want a couple of packages.
