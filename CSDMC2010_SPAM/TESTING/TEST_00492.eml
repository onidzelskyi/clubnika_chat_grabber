Thanks Ron.

Your option strings will do wonders for future e2fsck runs.  

But ... Why does the output say that the disk was modified
during the run? There were no badblocks found. What needed
modification?

Do you have similar magic for dumpe2fs?

Of course your output presented here indicates that
you HD is not one on which you can verify badblock
printing, since your disk has no badblocks.
