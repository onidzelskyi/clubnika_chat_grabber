In the days that I used dial-up modem, the kppp package was always very 
helpful for getting the modem working.  It was a small button that one 
clicked to activate the interface and once you were connected would just 
sit in the system tray (area near the clock) and blink red/ green for 
package transmission.  The genius of kppp was that it would 
automatically seek out the modem that was connected to the machine and 
configure it.  All I needed to do was to complete the account-related 
details, save them and then hit connect.  It is possible, and sometimes 
desirable, to use one DE (such as Gnome or KDE) but use packages 
associated with another DE.  For example, if you default to Gnome - 
which is a very good DE in terms of configuration capacity and ease of 
use - you can still use any number of KDE-related packages, one of which 
would be kppp.

I am privileged to have broadband so haven't had to think about this for 
a while, but you might want to use the CD set from Lenny (stable) only 
because, unlike testing, there will be very little in the way of needing 
to download packages and security fixes, etc. which otherwise will be a 
pain.

Welcome to GNU/ Linux Debian.  You will have a reasonably steep learning 
curve and will likely get frustrated and feel out of your depth.  This 
is all quite normal and except for the uber-geeks, most of us have 
probably had experiences which have caused us grief and rapid hair loss 
from self-inflicted pulling.  But, take things slowly, familiarise 
yourself with the command line because you can get a lot of things done 
there and once you are familiar with it, if the you-know-what hits the 
fan and you are back to a black screen/ white text situation you won't 
feel intimidated and lost.  Also, do lots of reading - there are some 
good on-line fora (e.g. http://www.linuxquestions.org ) and of course 
this mailing list - on which to ask questions.  These days though you 
should have a pretty easy ride and can usually accept most of the 
default configuration options out of the box.

I would certainly reiterate Thierry's comments about ensuring that your 
CD set is compatible with your system architecture, otherwise you will 
have a very unpleasant computing experience.

Hope this helps

AG
