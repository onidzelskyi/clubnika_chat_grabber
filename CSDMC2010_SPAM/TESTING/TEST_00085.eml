Hi, I have a somewhat unusual setup at work, where I connect to an OS X 
server from a Windows PC without an X11 server installed.  I use ssh 
sessions to do the bulk of my work, and view any graphical programs 
(Aqua and X11) via vnc (so I also login to the console).  I'm the sole 
user.

I was wondering if there is a way to determine, in my ssh sessions, the 
DISPLAY environment variable that launchd provides to the console user 
(it's fine if it only works if I am the logged in user).  Without that, 
as long as I've already launched X11 from the console, I can usually set 
DISPLAY=:0.  Very rarely I've had the vnc session go "black" with the 
only recover to kill the loginwindow process (killing the vnc server 
does not help in this situation).  I don't have root so cannot reboot. 
When this happens, I can login as normal, but X11 begins to use display 
:1 even though there is no longer an X11 process running on :0.  So I 
was hoping a cleaner approach might be possible.

This is a 10.5.8 system, running X11 2.5.0.

Thanks,
Brian
