Yes, I believe so.  I myself have never done it, but others on
this list have.

The new way makes things simpler for the maintainer script.  But it requires
that the user be more knowledgeable in customizing the kernel installation
process.

So the goal is to test a 2.6.33 kernel to see if it fixes a problem?
Debian does have 2.6.33 kernels available in "experimental".  If you install
a binary kernel image package from experimental, that will probably require you
to upgrade a bunch of other packages.  So in your case downloading the official
Debian kernel source for 2.6.33 is what I would recommend.  See this link:

   http://packages.debian.org/experimental/linux-source-2.6.33

You obviously don't have the usenet quoting style down just yet.  Note
the multiple repeated occurrences of the "greater than" sign to indicate
nested quoting.  Please make sure your quotes are at the appropriate
nesting level and with proper attribution.

Cheers,
SMP
