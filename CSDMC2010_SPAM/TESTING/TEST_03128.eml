It breaks mutt, relatime was invented to fix the mutt issue. A lot of netbooks 
and machines with only SSDs use noatime now, if noatime broke anything serious 
at any point, those issues will have been solved by now, SSDs have been out 
for some time and they need noatime.

Also possibly if you don't like the mount flags:
chattr -R +A /var/tmp

Also add
chattr -R +A $KDEHOME

The later is good for the config files.
