*Advanced Cosmic Ordering*
Life-changing system for getting what you want out of life 

What is Cosmic Ordering? Cosmic Ordering is a life-changing
system for getting what you want out of life! It involves placing
an "order" with the Universe and waiting for that order to be
"delivered". 

It's an exceptionally simple method, yet incredibly powerful.
Cosmic Ordering is endorsed by thousands of celebrities - perhaps
most famously by presenter Noel Edmonds, who used it to "order"
the creation, development and hosting of the "Deal or No Deal"
international TV franchise. 

Cosmic ordering enables you to "order" exactly what you want
from life such as: love, health, money, success. 

The specifics of cosmic ordering and the most effective methods
of using this powerful technique, are unveiled in the Advanced
Cosmic Ordering Kit. 

Please note: Cosmic Ordering does NOT involve tarot cards,
astrology, spirituality, or angels. It is based entirely on the
latest scientific research on the subject of energy. 

What you need are the real secrets behind cosmic ordering. These
are the tricks and shortcuts that have been developed by cosmic
ordering masters, the individuals that have been using this for
years - not quick fix information. You see the universe really
will work for you - you just have to speak it's language. 

And here are just a handful of the advanced cosmic ordering
tricks you'll uncover. 
-The seven steps to instant cosmic ordering - most guides get
these steps completely wrong. Screw this up and you might as well
go home now! 

-The three top myths about cosmic ordering - including one that
you should sit back and just wait for the universe to deliver.
Not entirely accurate! 

-The secret way you can literally test to see if your cosmic
ordering skills are working and it works almost instantly. 

-Why you must be careful what you wish for and how to "protect"
your ordering so it only ever works positively for you. 

-The six incredible truths about creating your own abundance in
life. Print these out and keep them with you at all times. 

-Should you add deadlines to your cosmic orders? Read what our
experts have to say about this hotly debated topic. The answer
just might suprise you. 

-The most common questions answered. Including whether it's more
powerful to order in the morning or at night, whether to write
your order or speak it out loud, whether to tell your friends,
finding a cosmic ordering buddy and more! 

*Advanced Cosmic Ordering Kit includes:

-The entire Advanced Cosmic Ordering course, consisting of
110+pages of condensed knowledge, from the world's leading cosmic
ordering experts. 

-A forty minute cosmic ordering walk-through audio session, plus
five individual cosmic ordering visualization sessions, for
money, health, love, success and emotional freedom. 

-4 exciting bonus gifts: 
	1. 45 minute cosmic ordering binaural beats recording. Listen
to this session to enter a deep state of meditation where your
cosmic ordering is even more powerful. 
	2. 10 minute digital caffeine wake-up. If you've been
meditating, just slip on your headphones and listen to this
recording. It's like caffeine for the brain. 
	3. 100 magical abundance affirmations. This guide provides
specially-worded affirmations to help deliver abundance in every
area of your life. 
	4. 2 free hypnosis sessions - inside our guide, you are shown
exactly how to use hypnosis with your cosmic ordering. With this
voucher you can claim your 2 hypnosis sessions from the
instant-hypnosis.com website. 

-Free International shipping.

It's the ideal package for anyone interested in cosmic ordering.
Perfect for beginners and experts alike, this kit will help you
achieve anything you want in life - just by asking for it. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


"Cosmic ordering works! I said I wanted a hit TV show. It had to
be something my girls would watch - and I wanted it by October. I
got the call about Deal or No Deal in August. It's spooky. "
Noel Edmonds
TV Presenter & Creator of "Deal or No Deal"

Ultimate Self Talk Series
Change your inner talk, change your life 

Self-Talk is probably the most powerful concept in the whole of
personal development. Discover how to "reprogram" your brain, by
changing the way you talk to yourself. Imagine stumbling across a
key that could genuinely unlock the potential of your mind - and
suddenly allow everything to fall into place. Read on and you'll
discover just how powerful it can be. 

Self-Talk is the stuff your brain is playing over and over to
itself, shaping how you act and ultimately carving out your
destiny. Since the day you were born, you've had all sorts of
"programming" entering your brain. This includes information and
commands, either coming from yourself, or from the outside world
(through your five senses). 

And the worst part is that most people don't even realize that
their self-talk is negative! You see, the brain doesn't
distinguish between "good" and "bad" commands. It simply accepts
the self-talk and uses it to shape your ultimate destiny. 

So how do you upgrade your self-talk from being just "okay" - to
being "fantastic"? By inputting positive, brain-friendly
self-talk into the brain - over and over again. Remember, the
brain is fantastic at recording new commands - and is flexible
enough to quickly overwrite old material. Not only that, but it
also adheres to the Law of Repetition. 

Here is what the entire Ultimate Self-Talk Series includes: 

-Distributed on two CDs, you'll find eight full Self-Talk
programs, with morning, daytime and night sessions for each.
That's over nine and a half of MP3 recordings, covering the
following programs: 
	1. Create absolute happiness 
	2. Achieve amazing wealth 
	3. Find magical true love 
	4. Manifest an abundant life 
	5. Achieve your ultimate goals 
	6. Attain optimum health 
	7. Ultimate career success 
	8. Gain amazing self-confidence 

-The Ultimate Self-Talk Series Success Guide. Confused by
Self-Talk? Our Success Guide will guide you through every step of
the process, showing you how to achieve total success with any of
our programs, in just 2 weeks or less! 

-Transcripts from every single Self-Talk Program. Discover
precisely what goes in to every Self-Talk Program - before you
listen to it. These transcripts provide everything you need, for
every session from every program. 

-Free International Shipping & Handling. We'll send your package
to absolutely anywhere in the world, entirely at our own cost! 

-Free Lifetime Support. Our support team is here to assist you
24/7. We'll give you the contact details for our dedicated
support team who can provide assistance anytime you need it. 

Self-Talk is one of the most powerful methods of changing your
life. So, don't miss this chance to discover the power of
Self-Talk for yourself. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


"The Ultimate Self-Talk Series is invaluable! There is no
greater service you can do to elevate your self-esteem and
improve the quality of every aspect of your life than to manage
your negative self-talk."
Dr. Joe Rubino
www.SelfEsteemSystem.com

Dream Meanings Kit
Discover what your dreams really mean 

Do you really know what your dreams mean? Dreams are "messages"
from the subconscious mind. Even if we don't realize it, each of
us dreams between 4 to 6 times every single night. And yet how
many of us think about what our dreams really mean? 

Ever dreamt of drowning? Flying? Dying? Being chased? Or maybe,
in your dream world, you've met relatives that have passed away?
Each of these encounters has a hidden message for you. And no
matter where you think the messages come from, there's an
established method for interpreting them that's been used now for
over 50 years. 

But maybe you don't think you even dream at all? Boy, is that
common! Millions of individuals will swear they never dream.
Incorrect! The truth is that we all dream, every single night. 

The problem is that the majority of us don't remember our
dreams. There are a few simple steps you can take to cure that
"forgetfulness" - and begin remembering the critical messages
that are playing in front of your mind, every day. 

Think about this for just one moment...You spend almost one
third of your life sleeping and dreaming. And yet - when was the
last time you dedicated just 5 minutes to thinking about
dreaming? Do it now. 

The Dream Meanings Kit is the world's only downloadable package
that is entirely dedicated to translating your dreams. It
contains everything you need to begin translating your dreams. 

-Copy of the course "The Truth Behind Dreams." This guide will
explain exactly what your dreams are all about and how you can
use just a little knowledge to easily find the hidden messages
from any dream situation. 

	--The truth behind what dreams really are - and why each of us
must dream every single day 
	--The 12 universal dream categories - and why they are
absolutely critical to understanding any dream 
	--Why over 80% of people have dreamt of being chased - and what
it really means! 
	--The secret behind "dream predictions" and whether what you
see will really come true.

	--5 secret methods of increasing the amount of dreams you have
each night 
	--The number one reason that most people have trouble
remembering their dreams - and how to combat it! 
	--The 10 little-known techniques for ensuring you remember
every dream you ever have! 
	--The first thing you should do as soon as you wake up (and no,
it isn't getting out your dream journal) 
	--Dream incubation - and how to use this secret method to get
your mind to provide solutions to your problems!

    <strong style="font-size: 14px;">Life-changing system for getting what you want out of life</strong>
    
    <br><br>What is Cosmic Ordering? Cosmic Ordering is a life-changing system for getting what you want out of life! It involves placing an "order"
with the Universe and waiting for that order to be "delivered".
    
    <br><br>It's an exceptionally simple method, yet incredibly powerful. Cosmic Ordering is endorsed by thousands of celebrities &mdash; perhaps
most famously by presenter Noel Edmonds, who used it to "order" the creation, development and hosting of the "Deal or No Deal" international TV
franchise.
    
    <br><br>Cosmic ordering enables you to "order" exactly what you want from life such as: love, health, money, success.

    <strong style="font-size: 14px;">Change your inner talk, change your life</strong>
    
      
    <br><br>Self-talk is probably the most powerful concept in the whole of personal development.
    Discover how to &quot;reprogram&quot; your brain, by changing the way you talk to yourself. Imagine stumbling across a key that could genuinely
unlock the potential of your mind - and suddenly allow everything to fall into place. Read on and you'll discover just how powerful it can be.
          
    <br><br>Self-talk is the stuff your brain is playing over and over to itself, shaping how you act and ultimately carving out your destiny. Since
the day you were born, you've had all sorts of &quot;programming&quot; entering your brain. This includes information and commands, either coming from
yourself, or from the outside world (through your five senses).
    
    <br><br>This "programming" is known as your self-talk. In other words, commands and programs that your brain has "recorded" - and which are
played back, over and over. These are programs which have ultimately shaped your life - and they're not always positive.
    
    <br><br>And the worst part is that most people don't even realize that their self-talk is <u>negative</u>! You see, the brain doesn't distinguish
between "good" and "bad" commands. It simply accepts the self-talk and uses it to shape your ultimate destiny. 
    
    <br><br>So how do you upgrade your self-talk from being just &quot;okay&quot; - to being &quot;fantastic&quot;?
    By inputting positive, brain-friendly self-talk into the brain - over and over again. Remember, the brain is fantastic at recording new commands
- and is flexible enough to quickly overwrite old material. Not only that, but it also adheres to the Law of Repetition.
    
      <br><br><strong>Here is what the entire Ultimate Self-Talk Series includes:</strong>
    
    <ul>
    <li>Distributed on two CDs, you'll find eight full Self-Talk programs, with morning, daytime and night sessions for each. That's over nine and a
half of MP3 recordings, covering the following programs:

        <li>Create absolute happiness</li>
        <li>Achieve amazing wealth</li>
        <li>Find magical true love</li>
        <li>Manifest an abundant life</li>

    <strong style="font-size: 14px;">Discover what your dreams really mean</strong>
    
    <br><br>Do you really know what your dreams mean? Dreams are &quot;messages&quot; from the subconscious mind. Even if we don't realize it, each
of us dreams between 4 to 6 times every single night. And yet how many of us think about what our dreams really mean?
    
    <br><br>Ever dreamt of drowning? Flying? Dying? Being chased? Or maybe, in your dream world, you've met relatives that have passed away? Each of
these encounters has a hidden message for you. And no matter where you think the messages come from, there's an established method for interpreting
them that's been used now for over 50 years.
    
    <br><br>But maybe you don't think you even dream at all? Boy, is that common! Millions of individuals will swear they never dream. Incorrect! The
truth is that we all dream, every single night.
    
    <br><br>The problem is that the majority of us don't remember our dreams. There are a few simple steps you can take to cure that
&quot;forgetfulness&quot; - and begin remembering the critical messages that are playing in front of your mind, every day.
    
    <br><br>Think about this for just one moment...You spend almost one third of your life sleeping and dreaming. And yet - when was the last time
you dedicated just 5 minutes to thinking about dreaming? Do it now.
