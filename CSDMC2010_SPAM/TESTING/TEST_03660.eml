What is the aim of formatting the disk this way. Why not have a single
partition and backup into there, into some sort of directory structure
like <mntpoint>/YYYYMMDD/

great you used DD to backup a filesystem that isn't/doesn't change.
Waste of space using DD

I wonder why.... in 1 hour the filesystem would have been used so the
initial part of the backup would have been done whilst the fs was in one
state and the last part of the backup whilst it was in a different
state.

if you really must use dd which is not a backup utility. you have to
stop all the processes and mount all the filesystems as read only.

in fact install another os on the 500G drive, that just does the backup
of the original system to the 500G drive.

maybe have a look at http://www.mondorescue.org/

I accept the fact that if I loose my system I am going to have to
partially build a new system, install the base system.

I have kept copies of my apt/dpkg db for restoration if need and I use
rsync to backup all of my files (except for obvious things like /dev),
this backups to a compressed fuse fs so I get compression as well,
incremental backups.

another tool to look at is tar
