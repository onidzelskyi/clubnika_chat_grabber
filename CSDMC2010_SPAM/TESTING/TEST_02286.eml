You once said a man could be what he liked if he tried hard enough, so why shouldn't you be a poet? asked Rose, liking to trip him up with his own words, as he often did her.
Ay, old sly fox, you are right, we are swindled like--like shareholders! said Crevel. All such women are an unlimited liability, and we the sleeping partners. 

There's my antagonist's pistol, sir, he said. You'll see his initials on it. But you are travelling together!   That suits me. .It shall be a happy one if I can make it so, and to-morrow you will give me the dear right to try.  
Do you suppose, my dear little papa, that our /Review/ is ever read abroad?  

Is he in love with you?  Ah, Captain Wilbourn, we've won a victory, but it is dearly bought, when it deprives us of the services of General Jackson, even for a short time!

<title> He swept by them like a storm, vanishing through the hall below like some living flame of fire. They both understood that he wore that robe for protection, and that throughout the house the heralds of the approaching powers of the imprisoned Letters were therefore already astir. His steps echoed below them in the depths of the building as he descended to the cellar, intent upon some detail of the appalling consummation that drew every minute nearer.  'Yes, sir; but there's the hot-water pipes inside--and there's no getting at it, except for a plumber.'

We'll be in by noon, was Smith's greeting as they met on the companionway for a swim.  In this earthly paradise of pure love, undefiled, she spent three full days and part of another. On the morning of the fourth, she sent the country girl they had engaged to take care of the children, out on the moor with the little ones, while she herself and Bertram went off alone, past the barrow that overlooks the Devil's Saucepan, and out on the open ridge that stretches with dark growth of heath and bracken far away into the misty blue distance of Hampshire. Bertram had just been speaking to her, as they sat on the dry sand, of the buried chieftain whose bones still lay hid under that grass-grown barrow, and of the slaughtered wives whose bodies slept beside him, massacred in cold blood to accompany their dead lord to the world of shadows. He had been contrasting these hideous slaveries of taboo-ridden England, past or present, with the rational freedom of his own dear country, whither he hoped so soon with good luck to take her, when suddenly Frida raised her eager eyes from the ground, and saw somebody or something coming across the moor from eastward in their direction.  I want you not to see so much of Louis. I stepped up and had a 'go.' The machine bounded forward like an agile greyhound. You had but to touch it, and it ran of itself. Never had I ridden so vivacious, so animated a cycle. I returned to him, sailing, with the gradient reversed. The Manitou glided smoothly, as on a gentle slope, without the need for back-pedalling. 
You little goose, it 's just the way it was done in Paris, and the dancing is splendid. It seems queer at first; but you 'll get used to it, as I did.
Softly under her breath she began to whistle toward a shadow in the stable-yard. Usually, she whispered, there's a sleepy stable-boy lying round here somewhere. Oh--Bob! she summoned.
