Mike,

Thanks for responding, and explaining what causes the flickering.

And I don't. But like I said,

Please could you confirm that the 'In their own process' preference is
not currently available for 32-bit Macs (and whether there would be
any point in putting in an RFE).

Best regards,

Rob
