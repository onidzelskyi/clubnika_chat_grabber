Hi,

I have just bought a new 3-button mouse since 3-button emulation does not seem to work well in Lenny - I had a lot of trouble with unpredictable behaviour apparently due to contact bounce and getting unwanted context menus, some of whose entries were sometimes unintentionally activated, with bad effects - but unfortunately the new mouse is serial rather than PS/2.

I have done dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg as root in a terminal before starting kdm, but there was no mention of a mouse, only keyboard options were mentioned.  And the new mouse is completely non-functional after doing kdm.

I have also tried Xorg -configure, and the following message was given:

Xorg detected your mouse at device /dev/input/mice.  Please check your config if the mouse is still not operational, as by default Xorg tries to autodetect the protocol.  Your xorg.conf file is /root/xorg.conf.new.

The only mentions of the mouse in /root/xorg.conf.new are in the first section:

Section "ServerLayout"
        Identifier     "X.org Configured"
        Screen      0  "Screen0" 0 0
        InputDevice    "Mouse0" "CorePointer"
        InputDevice    "Keyboard0" "CoreKeyboard"
EndSection

and in a later section:

Section "InputDevice"
        Identifier  "Mouse0"
        Driver      "mouse"
        Option      "Protocol" "auto"
        Option      "Device" "/dev/input/mice"
        Option      "ZAxisMapping" "4 5 6 7"
EndSection

I ran X -config /root/xorg.conf.new to test the new xorg.conf, but the new mouse was still nonfunctional.  It was plugged into Serial port 1, and I also tried going into the BIOS and altering Onboard Serial Port A from 3f8h/COM1 to Auto, but this didn't help either.

Are serial mice supported in Lenny?

Best regards,
Chris Austin.
