I'm not asking them to promote our groups prominently.  I just want them to
publicly acknowledge our existence in a proud fashion and not hesitate to
mention us to their customers when appropriate.

The store had indicated that they would provide the
program/presentation/presenter.  Are we supposed to come up with a backup
presentation and presenter for every meeting we plan, in case the meeting
falls through?  Not really gonna happen and I doubt any user groups do that
(except for occasions where they have reason to believe an out-of-town
presenter's appearance could fall through).

Everything about the situation was negative.  I don't see any point in
putting a smiley face on it.

The only positive that came about was for the board to swear we will never
rely on that store again.  We now have the freedom of not relying on such
careless individuals for the focus of one of our meetings.

Yes, we really do.

Increasingly, the average owner/user of Apple products thinks that the local
Apple Store is the one and only place for to further the Apple experience.
The message of user groups is lost in the scale of the Apple media presence.

Let me make an analogy...  At music fairs like Lollapalooza and Lilith Fair,
there are secondary stages where lots of great musicians and groups get
major exposure.  They're not getting the limelight, but they sure get in
front of lots of people they wouldn't otherwise.

Not only do we not get secondary stage placement, but we can't even hang out
at the gate to the event and have a banner or people handing out flyers
about our groups.

Chris
