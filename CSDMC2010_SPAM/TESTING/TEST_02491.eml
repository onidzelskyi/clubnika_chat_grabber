Thanks for mentioning this. I was particularly interested to see what
would happen here on my 32-bit MacBook, where I don't seem to have the
option of selecting the 'In their own process' preference--the radio
buttons are greyed-out--which appears to be required in order to avoid
the flickering seen on resizing the browser window.

Lo and behold, there is no flicker! :-D

However, on the downside, two-finger scrolling (inside the applet) is
not supported (as it is in Safari) :-(
