Yes, but there are some nuances. Let's take my example: how would you
have done this? You need to transmit the document, but the receivers are
sufficiently dishonest to print it and to claim they are the authors.

Yes, but if I had to use closed specs. with closed softwares, I would
have to pay, and what about paying for your own rights??
