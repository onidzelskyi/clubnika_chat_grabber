Even Gnome starts in seconds now. I agree, startup time is absurd,
especially with Akonadi.

It should improve for KDE 4.5. Aaron (the head Plasma dev) recently
discussed some changes to the Activities, and the possibility of
hiding the feature in 4.5 until it is mature in 4.6.

Really? Please file those crashes! I though that all the serious Kmail
crashers were fixed!

Can you file a bug on that? I cannot reproduce, but I am not a Kmail
user, only occasionally test it.

With Akonadi (4.4)? I don't find it slow at all, and I'm pushing 500 contacts.

Please elaborate.

Yes, please!

Agreed. As a non-native English speaker who knows where the term came
from, it does make me sick.
