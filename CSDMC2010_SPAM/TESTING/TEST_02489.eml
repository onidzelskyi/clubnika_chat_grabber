How are you doing, Uli Kusterer.
I visit your blog from time to time. I didn't know that you were on this 
mailing list.

By the way, yes, you are right. My intention is something like that, but 
it is also for making the environment safer.

For example, let's assume we are trying to design C++ for the private, 
protect, public. ( or @private, @protect, @public if it is Obj-C )
Because we realize that it is good to protect parent class' member 
variables and member functions, we started to think about those 
keywords, i.e. private, protect and public. Let's also assume that for 
some cases it is thought to be safer not to access parent class' 
members. ( semantically "private" )

However, some people will still say, "Don't access parent classes' 
member directly. You can control what you want to do. It is your 
responsibility to access parent classes' member and makes trouble."

However, I am suggesting, "Even though you are right, it is better to 
provide some facility which can control how you want to access the 
parent classes' members."

I'm sorry, Jonathan Schleifer. I should mention your comment,

"Again, C allows you to do bad things if you use it the wrong way. But 
it does not consider a way right or wrong, so you have the freedom to do 
what you want. If it breaks, it’s entirely your fault. The same is true 
for ObjC. C and ObjC come from the Unix world, not the Windows world. 
Keep that in mind."

Well, I have been a long time Unix programmer also. However, I know Unix 
philosophy. But there is no philosophy which can be applied without 
exception. For example, let's pick one example, "ping".
Unix society amended "ping" to protect "ping flooding" and "buffer 
overrun". If they followed the "Unix philosophy" very strictly, they 
should have not fix the problem, saying "You have the freedom to do what 
you want. if it breaks, it's entirely your fault."

I'm sorry, I doesn't mean to offend you, Jonathan Schleifer.
I'm sorry.

Sincerely,
JongAm Park
