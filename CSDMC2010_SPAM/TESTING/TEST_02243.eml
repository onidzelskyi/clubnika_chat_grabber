special offer on two products that have the power to change your
life. 

-Brain Bullet - the ultimate brain power development software
automatically motivates, empowers, and re-educates your mind.

charge of your life and create a better future for yourself. 

Now, through this exclusive offer, when you buy the new Brain
Bullet for only $39.97, you will receive Life Makeover for FREE
(that's a savings of $47.00)!

http://dr.bluehornet.com/ct/2720056:2756507415:m:3:133771572:84BC9F49D7DAB9285593C676E1C042D3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
Brain Bullet
Aim, fire and achieve! 

With Brain Bullet you can: 

-Increase your mental powers and abilities 

-Activate "super-learning" and advanced thinking 

-Empower yourself with unstoppable confidence 

-Blast through limitations with ZERO effort 

-Achieve your goals... be who you want to be! 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


What is Brain Bullet? 

It's a software application that sits on your Windows desktop,
that delivers safe, positive and unobtrusive affirmations on your
computer's screen. Because of the speed in which they're
delivered to your screen, your conscious mind will merely see a
"flicker" - it won't have the pace to capture the message. And
that's great - because, your "conscious" mind isn't responsible
for changing your automatic reactions and habits. Only your
subconscious is! 

Your brain is a fascinating machine that has the capability to
absorb thousands of pieces of information daily. So it makes
sense that if your brain "reacts" to the information it is fed
that you should probably feed it the best information you can,
right? 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


That's where Brain Bullet enters the scene! Brain Bullet is easy
to use in just 3 easy steps: 

Step 1: Choose your affirmations--You just select the checkbox
next to the affirmation groups you want - or, you can edit/create
brand new groups with an unlimited number of new affirmations per
group.

Step 2: Customize the Program to suit your needs--Brain Bullet
offers you a comprehensive, yet easy to use control panel that
allows you to customize all the advanced features of the
program... literally, with just a click or two.

Step 3: Click OK and Let Brain Bullet go to work! When you click
"OK", Brain Bullet automatically retreats to the system tray on
your desktop and will continue to work for you in the
background... without any effort or work on your part!

The program automatically interacts with your desktop
environment, displaying your affirmation files "on the top" of
your screen, without interfering with your operation of the
computer. Brain Bullet will automatically cycle through each of
your selected affirmation groups, and display them randomly (to
an equal weight) at an interval you define - even while you're
using your PC for other tasks! 

With this tool, you're delivering positive, present,
self-inflicting statements of belief (affirmations) to your mind
every minute you're using the computer. Affirmations that are
captured by your subconscious brain, analyzed and then
"processed" unconsciously... without any effort or work required
from you. It's all automatic! You'll never want to work on your
PC again without it. We mean it. 

It's truly the most powerful, time independent, effortless and
EASY TO USE personal development and life betterment tool you're
likely to ever find. Just think. Now every minute at your
computer, means the chance to better yourself... reach your
goals... attain your ambitions... and be the person you want to
be. 

And now, through this exclusive offer, when you buy Brain Bullet
for $39.97, you will receive Life Makeover for FREE! (That's a
savings of $47!)
