I mean to install from it ;-) ... cause it will use the kernel that it is
booting with (AFAIK)
If you are able to boot from the live cd or usb then you can use those
kernels for your new system (or for a fallback to debug further)

Did you try reinstalling grubinto your MBR or debugging the initrd?

In your situation I would just put this old disk in my new pc and install
using debootstrap. then configure the system and put the drive back in the
target pc. it will take about 1h.

good luck
