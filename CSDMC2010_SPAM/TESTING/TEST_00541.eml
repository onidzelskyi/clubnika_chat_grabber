If you've been around that long, then why is it that you didn't know to
reply to the list instead of to me personally?  Please post *and* reply
*only* to the list.  You can CC someone if they ask for a CC, but always
include the list as one of your recipients.

That is not the proper procedure.  Read the release notes.
The most important step you missed is to issue "aptitude dist-upgrade"
*before* the "aptitude full-upgrade", but there are other steps you left
out as well.  I speak from experience.  I tried to upgrade a system from
Etch to Lenny by "winging it" and not following the upgrade procedure
listed in the release notes, and my system was almost unusable.  Fortunatel=
y
I had another system on which I had installed Lenny directly, and by compar=
ing
installed packages between the install-Lenny-from-scratch system and the
upgrade-from-Etch-to-Lenny system I was eventually able to recover my syste=
m.
But it took many days.  Following the upgrade procedure in the release note=
s
is very important.  Take it from one who learned that the hard way.

Neither do I.  Maybe someone else has some ideas, but I'm out.  I don't kno=
w
about you, but I know what I would do if it were me.  I'd reinstall from
scratch.  (I always keep /home in a separate partition for just such
occasions as this.)  I'd reinstall from scratch and reformat the / partitio=
n.
If you don't have /home as a separate partition then back up the /home dire=
ctory
somewhere first so you won't lose your personal files.  I strongly recommen=
d
that you make /home a separate partition in your new install, if it isn't n=
ow.

I also recommend that you use the latest "daily build" development version
of the Debian installer if you want to install Squeeze directly.
That's the only version of the D-I that I trust to install Squeeze at this
point.  Good luck.

If I had known in advace how much work it was going to be to recover my dam=
aged
system from a bad upgrade attempt, I wouldn't have even tried.  I would hav=
e
reinstalled from scratch.  You've got your system hosed up much worse than
mine was.  I recommend that you reinstall from scratch.  And next time,
read (and carefully follow) the release notes when you do an upgrade.
