The number of web sites offering news & information using feeds is
exploding! A feed is a regularly updated summary of web content, along wi=
th
links to full versions of that content.=20
When you subscribe to a given website's feed by using a feed reader, you'=
ll
receive a summary of new content from that website right on your screen o=
r
in a software feed reader.=20
Many websites are using feeds to publish their latest information right t=
o
thousands of users within minutes. Soon everyone will be using them. This
makes feeds the ideal place to advertise.

More and more people are subscribing to feeds every day and there are
millions who are already subscribed.
Thus, your ad will reach a very broad range of potential customers with
each use of Feed Blaster!

Feed Blaster is the first & only submitter that can submit your ads to
thousands of feeds within a few minutes!=A0


Post your ads where people read them!

- What if you could place your ad into all these feeds ?

Right, that would mean you would have millions of sites
linking to your ad - and millions of users reading your message within
minutes - and my idea actually works.
