Dear Friend,


I wish to inform you that this letter is not a hoax mail and I urge you to
treat it serious.I would have given you a call, but rather I decided to
contact you via an email to get us acquainted since it is a safer way of
private communication now.

Dear Friend, Something ago you receive email from my colleagues need your
assistance in repatriating the funds left behind by a late customer which
you believe is a scam or joke.But today, I'm happy to inform you about my
success in getting those funds transferred under the cooperation of a new
partner from LONDON. Presently I'm in LONDON for investment projects with
my own share of the total sum.Meanwhile, I didn't forget your past efforts
and attempts to assist me in transferring those funds despite that it
failed us some how.

Now contact my Bank officer, his name is MOHD ALI HALIM on and you can
also email him at ( mohdhalim@sify.com) ask him to send you the total sum
of $2,000,000.00(TWO MILLION US DOLLARS) which I kept for your
compensation for all the past efforts and attempts to assist me in this
matter. I appreciated your efforts at that time very much so feel free and
get in touched with my secretary Mr. Titus Uzo and instruct him where to
send the amount to you. Please do let me know immediately you receive it
so that we can share the joy after all the suffer ness at that time in the
moment,

I am very busy here because of the investment projects which I and the new
partner are having at hand, finally, remember that I had forwarded
instruction to the secretary on your behalf to receive that money, so feel
free to get in touch with him, he will send the amount to you without any
delay.
