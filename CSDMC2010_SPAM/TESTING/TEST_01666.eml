Good day to you.

I am Ahmed Malik, a manager with a private security and finance firm in Iraq. With the conviction and sentence to death of the formal leader of Iraq, Saddam Hussein for killing 148 people, I have decided to contact you on a very private issue. 

Before his arrest by the United States Army, Saddam as the President of Iraq used our company to move various consignments we believed contained large sums of money out of the country. With the heat of the war which lead to his arrest, few days before he escaped from the Presidential lodge, he deposited with our company, two consignments with a strict directive that it is treated as Diplomatic and sent to an affiliate company where he will direct a close confidant of his to pick them up but unfortunately, he was arrested in a cave by the United States soldiers with large sums of money also found with him contained in various containers with some of the US Soldiers held for questioning for some part of the funds stolen. Saddam as you know was placed on trial for war crimes and offence against humanity for which he has just been convicted, please see links below for further details.

Following his arrest, before our company moved the consignments out to our affiliate office where I will make available to you later, I was forced to open the consignments and found each consignment contained 45,000,000 Million Dollars carefully arranged in $100 Dollar bills, this makes a total of $90,000,000 Million United States Dollars. I have contacted you to pose as Saddam’s personal confidant and associate to lay claims to the consignments. Please take note that I have contacted you believing you are someone I can trust will not run away with the consignments and its contents after claiming them, this is an assurance I will want you to give me. I cannot claim this consignments, this is why I have contacted you to do it for us because I cannot be seen to claim it being a staff of the company. I will also be arrested by the Board of Directors of the company who I pledged to serve without my personal gains being above that of the company, so you must have to treat this tra
 nsaction absolutely confidential.

If you know you can handle this, I need you to respond immediately with the following:


1.	Your Full Names
2.	Contact Address
3.	Your age.
4.	Marital Status.
5.	Occupation.
6.	Personal Tel/Mobile Numbers.
7.	Country of Origin and Present country you reside in if not your country.
8.	Company or business name if you own and run your own business.

For your cooperation, assistance and partnership in this transaction, we will share the funds in the following ratio: 30% for your participation, 30% for me, 30% for the manager of our affiliate company where the consignments where moved to who I informed about this deal to facilitate the claim of the consignments by you and 10% to offset all it will cost to successfully lay claims to the consignments containing this money. This is an opportunity of a lifetime for us to make money that will last us and our families a long time, we can’t afford to loose it, understand.

I will give you further details when I have received your response. 

Best regards,

Ahmed Malik.
