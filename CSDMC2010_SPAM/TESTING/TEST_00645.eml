Nothing I've seen in dmesg has ever led me to think that the r8169 
driver in my Sid linux-source-2.6.31 kernel (yes, it's old; .32 and 
33 fail to build) loads a blob.

I sort of remember that.

I'm not surprised.  Since I'm only connected to a small 100Mbps LAN 
which then connects to a 12Mbps cable modem, it doesn't really 
affect me.

Maybe if I ever get .32 or .33 I'll squeal in anger.  Until then...
