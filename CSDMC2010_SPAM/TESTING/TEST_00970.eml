Hello Friend,

I am Mr. Adada an Oil merchant in Iraq; i have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer.
It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months 
to live, according to medical experts, just recently my doctor inform me i have a few weeks 
to live due to the esophageal cancer. I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never 
really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never 
generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only 
thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting 
to have or make all the money in the world. I have decided to give alms to charity organizations, 
as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. The last of my money which no one 
knows of is the huge cash deposit of fifteen million dollars $15, 000, 000,00 that I have with a 
Financial institution abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to 
charity organizations. It may interest you to know that i once asked members of my family to close one 
of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organization; they refused and kept 
the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what 
I have left for them.

I have set aside 10% for you and for your time.

God be with you.

Mr. Adada
