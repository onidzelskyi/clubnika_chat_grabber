## How to use
* 1. Grab chat once at day:
```{sh}
/usr/bin/python grab_chat.py
```
In results will be created (appended) *clubnica.txt* file with the last chat messages and updated file *timestamp.txt* with the last message's timestamp

* 2. Split to "with phone numbers" and "without phone numbers"
```{sh}
/usr/bin/python phone_number_extractor.py
```
Messages from the *clubnica.txt* file will be splitted to the files *phones.txt* for the messages with the phone numbers and *no_phones.txt* for the messages without phone numbers. 

## Debug: 
* 1. Check out messages without phone numbers were correctly placed in file *no_phones.txt*
```{sh}
 for i in $(cat mobile_codes.txt) ; do grep $i -r no_phones.txt ; done > del.txt
```

```{sh}
DEBUG = 0
```
to 
```{sh}
DEBUG = 1
```
